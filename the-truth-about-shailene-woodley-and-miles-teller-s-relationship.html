might not know about.</p><p>If you're a huge Shailene Woodley or Miles Teller fan, you'll probably already know that the pair have been working together since 2013 and have had a friendship ever since. If you didn't, well, now you know or probably found out in recent news.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They've played both lovers and enemies. Their first film together was The Spectacular Now, where they played unexpected lovers. Of course, they went on to co-star in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Divergent trilogy</a> (even though they never finished the franchise), where they played enemies.</p><p>After leaving the franchise, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teller's career stalled</a>,&nbsp;while Woodley <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took some time off to recover after an illness</a>. But now their careers are on the upturn. Woodley has starred in Big Little Lies&nbsp;and soon, The Last Letter from Your Lover, while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teller has worked on War Dogs</a> and will appear in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this year's Top Gun: Maverick</a>. But who knows, maybe they'll share the screen again sometime soon.</p><p>While we wait for those future projects, and while we watch the events of Teller and Woodley's recent couples vacation unfold, let's revisit one of our favorite celebrity friendships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-sabotaged-their-kissing-scenes>They&nbsp;Sabotaged Their Kissing Scenes</h2><p>Before either one of them was remotely famous, Teller and Woodley met on set of the indie film The Spectacular Now in 2012. Onset, they forged their friendship, just as their character's started a relationship with one another. Teller's character Sutter might have been a terrible influence on&nbsp;Woodley's&nbsp;innocent Aimee, but it turns out they were just as bad influences on each other off-screen.</p><p>As love interests, they kissed a lot, of course, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the co-stars liked to torture each other when they had to film the more romantic scenes</a>. Teller&nbsp;told Vulture that he drank Gatorade before their intimate scenes, which Woodley detested.</p><p>"She would be like, 'Are you serious? You're gonna kiss me after that?'" he said. "I was like, 'Yeah, I am.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also hated when he ate a Honey Bun before such scenes and said he was&nbsp;"going to taste like processed food."</p><p>In return, she'd have one of her herbal supplements right before kissing him, which he thought was gross and said, "...they tasted like crap ... We put stuff in our mouths so we could just offend each other," Teller said.&nbsp;"It was just this ongoing back-and-forth," Woodley added.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Shailene Woodley Has Done Since 'The Secret Life Of The American Teenager'</a></span></p><p>But those foul-mouthed kisses were worth it because they earned a&nbsp;nomination for "best kiss" at the 2014 MTV Movie Awards. Later, Woodley did confess that Teller was a pretty good kisser.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When they aren't sabotaging their on-screen kisses, they help each other in their own ways. "I think we help each other, though. He helps me, I think, have more fun when I get caught up in being serious. And I think I help ground himself in a way that's perhaps more natural than his other choices," Woodley told MTV.</p><p>During their first-ever sex scene, they both felt completely safe and comfortable with one another as well. So this clearly bonded them for life.</p><p>In 2014, Woodley told W that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wanted her and Teller to be a famous onscreen couple</a> rivaling the likes of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. She told Vanity Fair that she compares her and Teller's relationship to George Clooney and Julia Roberts'. "Their relationship I could see being our relationship in 20 years, and that really is special," she&nbsp;said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's A Closer Look At Shailene Woodley's Naturalistic Life</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Teller told The Hollywood Reporter, "With Shailene, I would love to work with her once every couple years. We work very similarly, and I think she’s very talented."</p><p>He also said they have similar work ethics. "As actors, Shailene and I match up well together because we have similar styles in that we do everything very honestly. We're not very showy actors, and I think our technique is just to be very present. So if she does something very different in the scene, I'm going to respond to that and vice versa, which is nice because you don't have to force somebody to come along with you. It's just very natural."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Woodley agrees. "We just naturally became friends, and he became my brother for life. I want to do a movie a year with him," she said.</p><p>In 2015, Teller presented Woodley with the Trailblazer Award at the MTV Movie Awards, and it was just another adorable moment between them.</p><h2 id=they-re-set-for-their-fifth-film>They're Set For Their Fifth Film</h2><p>In 2020, Deadline announced, to our delight, that the two friends are once again going to share the screen for the film The Fence, which is currently in pre-production. They're supposed to play newlyweds, so they'll probably&nbsp;resume their kissing war against one another once again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things Few People Know About Shailene Woodley</a></span></p><p>While that's been great news, there have been some other interesting developments in their friendship recently. Last week fans were surprised to see that the friends were on a couples vacation in Hawaii after Teller's wife, Keleigh Sperry, shared photos of them hiking and swimming. But their vacation wasn't completely perfect. On May 28, Maui police confirmed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teller had been punched in the face while out to dinner</a> with his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woodley, and her fiance, Aaron Rodgers</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sperry later revealed that Teller had been "jumped by two men" after they "trapped him in a bathroom." Apparently, the men are repeat offenders. The couple currently has the support of the Maui police as they conduct their investigation.&nbsp; The story that the altercation was about money is completely false, she said, and Woodley backed her up.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see the outcome of the investigation and hope that it didn't completely ruin the foursome's vacation. We just loved seeing them together again, though, and we know we'll probably continue to see them together on and off the screen. It's faction before blood, remember?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shailene Woodley Opens Up About Past Abuse And Physical Illness</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6tLTAoqOeppVixLC7w6WcsmWRo7FuucilnKxlpJq5rbHRrGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-charlize-theron-asked-protection-from-tom-hardy-while-filming-mad-max-fury-road.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Charlize Theron Asked Protection From Tom Hardy While Filming 'Mad Max: Fury Road'</a>
