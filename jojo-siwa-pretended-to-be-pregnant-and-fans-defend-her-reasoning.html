Given that Siwa had just broken up with her girlfriend, Avery Cyrus in December 2022, fans were confused by what they were seeing.</p><p>At the time, <a href=#>it was rumored that Siwa had a secret girlfriend</a>. Fans wondered if the pregnancy could be true and took screengrabs of the Snapchat in which Siwa had on-screen captions that read, "Can't believe it" and "Baby clothes shopping is my new favorite thing." Needless to say, the pictures went viral nearly immediately.</p><p>Some fans expressed their concern with Siwa being pregnant given that she was still a teenager. Others stated the post was nothing more than Siwa with a "food baby" after having eaten a large meal. Fans were unable to agree on what was happening.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jojo-siwa-1.jpg><p>Because the rumors of Siwa would not die down, according to Business Insider, Siwa took to TikTok to state she was not pregnant. This seemed to be the end of the pregnancy rumors and fans seemed relieved.</p><p>However, at the end of March, the "pregnancy" pictures again began to circulate. This time, a screengrab from Snapchat showed an on-screen caption that stated, "TEAM BOY OR TEAM GIRL."</p><p>Siwa returned to social media to make fun of the viral posts claiming she was pregnant. This time, according to Business Insider, Siwa and her friend Ezra Sosa filmed a Snapchat with Siwa holding her sweatshirt up. Sosa can be heard saying, "You know everyone thinks I'm the dad, right?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The on-screen caption read, "The father of my baby!!"</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Siwa posted yet another Snapchat that showed her shopping for baby clothes.

Given that the first time Siwa made a video about not being pregnant it was essentially ignored, she did what she thought was best and that was to make fun of the situation. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In making light, however, Siwa came under fire by many</a>.

Nor has it been disclosed just what Siwa was trying to donate.</p><p>However, fans are convinced that Siwa is a woman of her word.
