Children is one of the most important part of her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Their bond is evident, and Martha has actively involved Alexis in her brand, including guest appearances on TV shows and showcasing Alexis’ series on the Fine Living Network.</p><p><a href=#>Martha Stewart</a> has recently added another achievement to her impressive list as she graced the cover of the iconic Sports Illustrated Swimsuit magazine’s 2023 issue, becoming the oldest model to ever pose for the publication at the age of 81.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, Stewart revealed that while she is usually motivated by pay, this time she was driven by the desire to show people that a woman her age can still look good, feel good, and be confident.&nbsp;</p><p>She recognized the historic nature of her appearance and felt the pressure to look her absolute best.</p><p>For Stewart, who previously posed in nothing but an apron for a 2022 campaign without hesitation, showing up as her best self may not seem like a big deal.&nbsp;</p><p>However, her inclusion in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue is undeniably momentous.&nbsp;</p><p>Clinical researcher and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, Holly Thomas, expressed that seeing someone in their age group represented on magazine stands and in grocery stores will be empowering for midlife and older women.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You may also read:</strong> <a href=#>Evangeline Lilly Children, Husband, Illness, Relationship & Net Worth</a></p><p>The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue holds a special place in the American psyche regarding beauty ideals, making Stewart’s cover significant.</p><p>Thomas reflected on various “milestone” moments that have challenged exclusionary ideals in the fashion and beauty industry, citing the inclusion of the first Black woman and curvier women as examples.&nbsp;</p><p>These inclusions signify the evolution of beauty standards. Traditionally, magazine covers have represented the idealized notion of beauty, but over the past few years, people’s standards have become more expansive.&nbsp;</p><p>The hope is that this progress will continue, leading to more age diversity in media and portrayals of women considered beautiful or worthy of admiration.</p><p>MJ Day, the editor-in-chief of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, expressed the magazine’s goal to challenge the industry’s arbitrary notion of beauty.&nbsp;</p><p>She described Stewart as a legend and a great female entrepreneur who built a dynasty against all odds.&nbsp;</p><p>With her appearance in a bathing suit at the age of 81, Stewart also serves as a recalibration of assumptions about women and their sexuality as they age.</p><p>Embracing this evolution is at the forefront of Stewart’s mind. Her motto, <strong>“When you’re through changing, you’re through,”</strong> reflects her willingness to adapt, grow, and challenge societal norms.&nbsp;</p><p>By boldly stepping onto the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, Stewart has become an inspiration for women of all ages, proving that beauty, confidence, and sexuality are not limited by age.</p><p>While Martha Stewart’s children, Alexis may have had big shoes to fill, she has carved her own path as a successful television and radio personality, as well as an entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p><p>This article delves into the life and accomplishments of Alexis Stewart, highlighting her career, family, and connection with her iconic mother, Martha Stewart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Martha Stewart children, Alexis Stewart was born on September 27, 1965.
