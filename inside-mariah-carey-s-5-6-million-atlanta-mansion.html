accolades she has received during her unforgettable music career, <a href=#>Mariah Carey isn't known as the Queen of Christmas for nothing</a>. Her Christmas single, All I Want for Christmas Is You sold over 16 million copies when it was released. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cited by&nbsp;&nbsp;Forbes</a>, the talented vocalist makes $2.5 million each year around the holiday season from the hit single which was made over 30 years ago at the height of her success. This is just one example of how the singer/actress has built an empire of $320 million for herself at the age of 53.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among a few things the ageless artist and entrepreneur spends her fortune on, exceptional mansions are some of her most prized possessions. From New York to Los Angeles and even to the Bahamas, Carey has a pad for every location and most recently added to her portfolio with the purchase of a $5.6 million Atlanta mansion that was once rented by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Let's find out some of the <a href=#>features of this beautiful mansion.</a></p><h2 id=mansion-fit-for-the-christmas-queen>Mansion Fit For The Christmas Queen</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While her mansion resume may not be as extensive as the <a href=#>Savage Fenty entrepreneur Rihanna</a> or as widespread as the billionaire television network mogul, Oprah Winfrey, Mariah Carey definitely has style and expensive taste when it comes to her selections. Located in the posh region of Atlanta's Sandy Springs suburb, the Southern Colonial mansion spans almost 13,000 square feet and is perched on 4.2 acres of serene landscape. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Dirt,</a> the nine-bedroom and 13-bathroom mansion is decked with pristine white marble throughout the kitchen area, especially on the center island which contrasts effortlessly with the wood-paneled floors. Next door, there is a spacious family room with huge window-shaped doors that invite loads of natural sunlight into the sitting room and a fire place.</p><p>The new addition to three<a href=#> Guinness World Record holders'</a> home collections also features an indoor movie theatre, which is the perfect form of entertainment for her and her 10-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with who she shares custody of her ex-husband, Nick Cannon. Staying on the topic of entertainment and recreation, the massive property also features a mirror-walled gym where the legendary celebrity can keep her physique toned and sculpted for her adoring fans across the globe. Further indoor decorations include a massive master bedroom with its own fireplace along with the addition of Carey's signature glittery look on a pink and cream rug, a pink chandelier, and a giant velvet headboard. You might have remembered this look from her 2001 <a href=#>dance-pop and R&B</a> album, Glitter, which sold over 100 million albums worldwide, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Albumism.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>6 Surprising Facts About Mariah Carey's Income</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=other-note-worthy-features>Other Note-worthy Features</h2><p>Forget about California and New York; it seems that an increasing number of celebrities are opting to live in Atlanta or at least own property in that area. Earlier in February of 2022, it was the Avengers: End Game supervillain Thanos played by <a href=#>Josh Brolin who purchased a $3.25 million Atlanta estate</a> just north of the Buckhead community in Georgia. It turns out Carey also wasn't the first celebrity to soak in the peaceful surrounding foliage as the Hollywood movie extraordinaire, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, also rented the property while filming for the DC Comics film, Black Adam, starring Aldis Hodge and Pearce Brosnan, and is scheduled to be released in October 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuing with the amenities of the home, leading up to the estate is a gated driveway that vaguely resembles the shape of a heart that wraps around the front lawn and joins at the stair entrance to the mansion. The 1992 estate is also fitted with a sizeable swimming pool and a sprawling decking area neatly tucked away with the pool house against the dense greenery in the backyard. For guest accommodations, there is a large guest apartment with its own fireplace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also on the outside of the property is a grand tennis court that makes <a href=#>Drake's former YOLO Estate</a> seem lacking in size, although he makes up for it with an indoor basketball court. The clean-cut rolling lawns also feature a built-in pond and a seating area where one can enjoy the beauty of the towering trees bordering the property. Even without too many showy, fanciful ornaments, this home is simply beautiful and makes for a great escape from the city congestion.</p><h2 id=mimi-s-additional-properties>Mimi's Additional Properties</h2><p>Mimi has been a longtime musical success and as a result, has raked in quite a few properties for herself. One of her first purchases came early on in her career when she was married to the<a href=#> former CEO of Sony Music Entertainment, Tommy Mottola</a>, in New York. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RealEstate.com</a>, the music and film star bought the Tribeca penthouse for $5.5 million along with the apartment below for $3.5 million, totaling roughly $9 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her next property was a French-inspired chateau shared with her other ex-husband, Nick Cannon, which they sold for $88.3 million in 2014. The Los Angeles property comes equipped with 12 bedrooms, 15 bathrooms, a gym, a tennis court, a pool, pool house, and a 50-seat indoor theater.&nbsp;The couple also shared a second home in the Bel-Air of Los Angeles, but unfortunately, they didn't run into Will Smith on the set of Fresh Prince. It's unclear how much they bought it for, but they reportedly sold it for $9 million in 2015.</p><p>While she may not <a href=#>own her own island spread like the controversial Hollywood actor Johnny Depp</a>, Carey once owned her own estate on the private Windermere Island in the Bahamas. She purchased the home for $4.9 million in 2008 around the same time her surprise wedding to Nick Cannon was announced. The exclusive 3-acre compound was sold, however, in 2015 for $5.5 million. And as we can clearly see, she has no intentions of stepping away from the real estate business any time soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><strong>READ NEXT: <a href=#>10 Luxurious Mansion Rihanna Has Once Called Home</a></strong></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RealEstate.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Albumism,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipqOesaZ5zJqpopmYYrCivsSyqmZtXWt6rrXLpaCopl2Wwa2tza2YZqWRo8Cqu81o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jane-russell-net-worth-therichest.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jane Russell Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
