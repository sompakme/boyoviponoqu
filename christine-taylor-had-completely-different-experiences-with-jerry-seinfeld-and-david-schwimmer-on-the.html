Taylor revealed that she was always treated like an equal by Jerry, and that he especially took an interest in her upbringing.</p><p>“The scenes that I had with Jerry, where he just was really the most normal — for being Jerry Seinfeld.

And, you know, I grew up Catholic. And so of course, he was fascinated with details about that. And going to Catholic school and wearing uniforms. And just like, coming from Allentown, Pennsylvania, where I came from. But we just had these fun conversations. And he was so easy to talk to and just a good guy.

As far as Friends was concerned, Taylor was given the role and didn't have any type of audition. She jumped on the part instantly. “I didn't even have to audition,” Taylor said. “I had already done ‘The Brady Bunch’ and had a little work under my belt. I got the call saying, ‘Hey, do you wanna do an arc on "Friends"? I said, ‘Absolutely, hands down.’ I don't even need to read it. Just yes, yes, yes, of course."</p><p>As for her time on Seinfeld, Taylor recalls her audition being extremely stressful and in front of some major stars in the business.</p><p>She tells Today, “Knowing you were going to go in and read with Jerry and the writers was so nerve-wracking,” she said. “You go into this office, which is right sort of near the soundstage that they shot on. But as an actress, you just kind of get a parking pass that's like a mile away. And then you walk all the way. And you're dressed up and you want to do a good job.
