Whether it’s behind-the-scenes drama about the <a href=#>latest season of the show</a> or interesting facts about our favorite queens, we’re always in search of the best RPDR content. Speaking of content, there are a few creators on the popular platform of YouTube that cover the show and all things surrounding it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yes, we’re talking about the channels that produce recap shows, drama explanations, and everything else in between. YouTube is one of our <a href=#>favorite ways to keep up with all things RPDR</a>, and there are a few channels that specialize in that specific style of content. Here are 8 RPDR YouTube creators/channels that you should be following if you aren’t already.</p><h2 id=mera-mangle><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mera Mangle</span></h2><p><a href=#>Mera Mangle</a> is one of the few creators on this list that is also a drag queen. As one of the most popular RPDR-themed YouTube channels, Mera knows how to produce a lot of enticing content. Yes, Mera does it all: From hosting “Mangled Morning” with co-host Scarlett Syanide to reacting to the show live, there’s something for everyone to watch on the channel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because Mera isn’t a new RPDR creator, she’s pretty well known in the multiverse of the show. Mera has a bunch of RuGirl interviews with some of our favorite queens including Heidi N Closet and Pangina Heals. Really, Mera’s interview with RuGirls is practically a whole series in itself.</p><p>Most popular video: <a href=#>Queens that have QUIT DRAG! | Rupaul’s Drag Race Review | Mangled Morning</a></p><h2 id=matty-rants><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Matty Rants</span></h2><p>Matty Rants has a different content style than many of the other creators on this list, and it’s incredibly refreshing. While there are still plenty of videos on their channel that are edited and pre-recorded, Matty is one YouTuber known for going live. Yes, that’s right: You can find Matty going live on YouTube reviewing current seasons of RPDR! Matty will typically post before they’re set to go live, so make sure you’re tuned in to catch their reviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matty’s approach to content is one that we really gel with, and it really makes us feel like we’re listening to one of our <a href=#>favorite podcasts</a>. Matty prides themselves as being a true friend over a creator, aka “the shoulder to cry on, the friend to call and the one that will still set you straight.”</p><p>Most popular video: <a href=#>Rupaul’s Drag Race - Season 10 - Episode 1/Untucked - Rant & Review</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>13 Drag Families That Have Competed On 'RuPaul's Drag Race'</a></span></p><h2 id=jackfed><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>JackFed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>JackFed</a> is one content creator we just cannot seem to get enough of. Really, their content style is so engaging, it’s very different from many fandom-inspired channels we’ve seen before. JackFed is known for creating engaging videos on YouTube that really feel like pieces of modern journalism. We’ve all seen major digital publications research into different cultural phenomena (hello, Vulture’s <a href=#>nepo baby piece</a>), and JackFed does this with all things RPDR.</p><p>Their content is for RPDR fans that love the show enough to both <a href=#>criticize and appreciate</a> varying elements of its makeup. Whether they’re over-analyzing a season’s edit or <a href=#>ranking lip sync performances</a>, JackFed’s content is going to reel you in. If you’re interested in reviewing some of the <a href=#>major events</a> that have taken place throughout the course of <a href=#>RPDR herstory</a>, you’ll want to head over to JackFed’s channel ASAP, as they’ve probably already got a video up about it.</p><p>Most popular video: <a href=#>The Lost Season 12 Edit</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-drag-detective><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Drag Detective</span></h2><p>This creator calls himself the <a href=#>Drag Detective</a>, and it’s clear as to why: He’s always investigating everything RPDR. By self-definition, the Drag Detective (aka Derek) promises to look into “the editing, storytelling, and production decisions on RuPaul’s Drag Race,” and that he does. While you can find other creators doing recap episodes surrounding the latest seasons of the show, the Drag Detective takes an all-different approach to RPDR content creation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Drag Detective’s most popular style of YouTube videos has to be the “riggory” series, where Derek goes challenge by challenge to investigate the decisions made on the show. Really, there’s been some pretty <a href=#>questionable moments</a> that have come out of RPDR, and you can find the Drag Detective calling this out, showing what “would have happened” had there been no riggory in a season. The YouTube channel has many other videos that continue to dive deeper into the structure of the show, and we’re sure you’re going to love the content you come across.</p><p>Most popular video: <a href=#>The Riggory of Drag Race Season 11</a></p><h2 id=bussy-queen><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bussy Queen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If we’re talking about RPDR content creators, you’ve probably heard of this one or seen their videos in your YouTube feed. Of course, we’re talking about the one and only <a href=#>Bussy Queen</a>! As the most followed YouTuber on this list (with 209k), Bussy is a creator and drag queen that has been referenced by some of our <a href=#>favorite queens</a> of all time. She is known for giving <a href=#>commentary on all aspects of RPDR</a>. If you’re looking for a consistent RPDR review show that comes out exceptionally fast after episodes air, you’re going to want to tune into Bussy’s infamous “Hot or ROT?” series.</p><p>While Bussy does review the show as it airs, she’s also known for some of her other videos that have drawn in large numbers to her channel. Like many RPDR YouTube channels, Bussy dives deep into the burning questions that many fans and viewers are dying to know but are a little too scared to ask. Really, Bussy has content covering everything from the Tamisha Imann and Monét X Change drama to the stipulations of the RPDR contract that queens adhere to. If there’s one thing we count on Bussy for, it’s to spill the tea on any major drama happening in the RPDR multiverse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most popular video: <a href=#>Exposing the Rupaul’s Drag Race Contract</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Queens From 'RuPaul's Drag Race' That Have Competed Three Times</a></span></p><h2 id=green-gay><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Green Gay</span></h2><p>If you’re a diehard RPDR fan, <a href=#>Green Gay</a> is one channel you need to be tuning into. Everyone loves a good recap episode, but Green Gay really pushes the scope on content that can be made surrounding the show. Everyone knows that there’s varying <a href=#>behind-the-scenes moments</a> that happen before, during, and after filming a season of a show, and Green Gay is one creator that’s going to report on all of these things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have also been some pretty controversial events to happen surrounding the queens and show itself, and let’s be real — the fans want to know the real tea. Green Gay is the creator to deliver just that, creating content that aims to spill everything that we’ve been dying to know. They place emphasis on “<a href=#>quality over quantity</a>,” and that’s evident in each video posted by Green Gay. Each video carries a professional feel that is so clearly produced with a journalist approach. We truly can’t get enough of this channel.</p><p>Most popular video: <a href=#>Why Rupaul Fired Delta Work & Mathu Anderson</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Every Rusical From RuPaul's Drag Race, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=imho-the-show><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>IMHO: The Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike most of the channels on this list, <a href=#>In My Humble Opinion: The Show</a> is made up of three creators who all happen to be drag queens. Yes, we love watching RPDR content when it’s generated by fellow queens, can you tell? Darby Lynn Cartwright, Alexis Bevels, and Aunty Chan are the faces of IMHO, and they’re here to “watch TV so you don’t have to!”</p><p>Their content focuses on reviewing drag television shows. Yes, you read that right: IMHO doesn’t only review the OG RPDR, they also recap other favorites like RPDR UK, Canada vs The World, and Dragula Titans. If you’re looking to watch a few hilarious queens as they assess one of your favorite shows, then you need to subscribe to IMHO’s channel.</p><p>Most popular video: <a href=#>IMHO: Ice Skating w/ Denali Foxx</a></p><h2 id=u><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>U.</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether you’re a fan of this creator or not, you can’t deny that they’ve changed the way that fans and viewers look at certain elements of RPDR forever: Yes, it’s <a href=#>U.</a>! While U. may be one of the most <a href=#>controversial creators</a> that covers elements of RPDR, they created a very popular judging system that many other creators often reference. The criteria for U.’s methods is mainly quantitative based, evaluating the track records of all the queens, but also incorporating a qualitative edit relating to storylines.</p><p>The system involves looking at all elements of a queens' performance by episode, generating a points per episode score (PPE). The whole system can be a little confusing if you haven’t watched any of U.’s videos, and some argue that it places too much emphasis on track records and “numbers” per se. Nonetheless, their content has sparked many conversations among the RPDR multiverse… and isn’t that what good journalism is supposed to do?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most popular video: <a href=#>Who should have won each season of Drag Race (based on my criteria)</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiprqiRqrm0ecOrmKBlopawpnnYqKytrZKaeqS0wKelnqRdp7Kkrc9mqZ6umZrEbq7UrKqyZaGqsqa6jg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./charlotte-mckinney-s-hottest-bikini-photos-through-the-years.html>&#171;&nbsp;Charlotte McKinneys Hottest Bikini Photos Through the Years</a>
