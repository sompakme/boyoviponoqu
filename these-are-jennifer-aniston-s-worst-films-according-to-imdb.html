you're just as much of a <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> fan as we are, then you'd probably agree that she's never done a bad film in her decades-long career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, IMDb would have to disagree with that. Unfortunately, Aniston's career hasn't always been perfect; there have been some doozies.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She should have rejected</a> a lot of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her earliest films</a> and a couple of her later films because they have not garnered a good Metascore on the site at all. Thank God she went on to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">make better career moves</a>, sort of. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She turned down SNL</a> but took Rachel Green on Friends, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she almost didn't get</a>.</p><p>Now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's the most famous ex-cast member of Friends</a> and is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being paid more</a>&nbsp;for The Morning Show than what she got for playing Rachel, even though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wanted to quit acting</a> right before she got hired,&nbsp;but it all worked out.</p><p>Just out of curiosity, though, we took a look at her worst-scored films, and they really aren't too surprising.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-must-be-a-mistake>There Must Be A Mistake</h2><p>For some reason, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aniston's worst film</a> is a film we're quite sure she never appeared in; 2021's Music, which was directed by Sia and featured Kate Hudson. We don't know why it sits on her list, but the film scored 3.1.</p><p>Her next worst film was her first-ever credit, 1988's Mac and Me. On her IMDb, it says she's uncredited. It scored a 3.4.</p><p>Next is 1998's The Thin Pink Line, which came out four years into her run as Rachel Green on Friends. It's a mockumentary about a flamboyant male supermodel called Chauncey Ledbetter,&nbsp;a convicted of murder and sentenced to death. This film didn't inspire anyone, so it received a score of 3.8.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fourth on the list is another mistake. They list a film called Abbey Singer (2003), but Aniston did not appear in this either. It's not listed on her list of credits on IMDb but did score a 4.8.</p><p>Then there's 1997's 'Til There Was You, starring Jeanne Tripplehorn and Dylan McDermott. Aniston played Debbie, a character who looks like she has everything on the outside, making Gwen jealous, but things are not as they seem on the inside. It's another cheesy rom-com that only scored a 4.8.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Justin Theroux Really Feels About His Ex, Jennifer Aniston</a></span></p><p>The next on her list of worst films may surprise you.</p><h2 id=a-couple-of-surprises-a-couple-of-no-surprises>A Couple Of Surprises, A Couple Of No Surprises</h2><p>After 'Til There Was You&nbsp;comes 1993's Leprechaun, a year before Friends, and Aniston's first film. If you're familiar with older horror films, then this film is always on the must-watch list. It's so bad it's good, with a score of 4.8.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston played Tory Reding, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a teenager being hunted by a leprechaun</a> played by Harry Potter and Star Wars alum Warwick Davis.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern</a>, Aniston thought, "I arrived when I did Leprechaun," she said. "It was with Warwick Davis; the guy from Willow was in it. It was a big deal! I really did think it was an amazing thing that I was in a movie."</p><p>Years later, her boyfriend at the time, Justin Theroux, wanted to watch it with her, but she couldn't watch it without cringing.</p><p>"I watched it like, 8 years ago with our mutual friend Justin Theroux for shits and giggles," she explained. "We were dating. It was one of those things when I tried to get that remote out of his hand, and there was just no having it. He was like, 'No, no, no, no, this is happening.' I just kept walking in and out, cringing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston's Best Movies, According To IMDb</a></span></p><p>Next on the list is 2012's $ellebrity, a documentary where "celebrity photographer Kevin Mazur gives an all-access pass to life behind the velvet rope and in front of the camera." Aniston appears with Jennifer Lopez and Sarah Jessica Parker. It got a score of 5.5.</p><p>Next is 1997's rom-com Picture Perfect, one of Aniston's more famous rom-coms, which earned a score of 5.5. Aniston&nbsp;played the main character, Kate, an advertising executive who is forced to pretend to be engaged to&nbsp;Jay Mohr's&nbsp;character Nick to impress her boss, played by Kevin Dunn. Kevin Bacon also stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, it was always picture-perfect on set, however. According to Mohr himself, Aniston was mean to him, constantly heckled him, and even drove him to break down and cry a few times to his mom. Aniston has never confirmed this, though.</p><p>Her next worst film is 2005's Rumor Has It..., which also scored a 5.5. This was the year Aniston and Pitt divorced, and many rumors were spreading about the scandal, so this film, with a name like that, couldn't have come out at a worse time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Jennifer Aniston's Experience On Friends</a></span></p><p>The film had a star-studded cast, including Mark Ruffalo, Shirley MacLaine, and Kevin Costner, and followed Aniston's Sarah Huttinger. She<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;finds out that her family was used as inspiration for the film The Graduate.</a>&nbsp;She also has an affair with Costner's character and later finds out he could be her dad. Awkward. Despite that scandal and the one she was living through at the time, Aniston thought it was a great movie to star in post-Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was fun and light. Being my first job after Friends, I felt it was a nice little delicate step out of the nest," Aniston told Female.com. "It wasn't that complicated and I also really thought, as far as these romantic comedies, go, this was interesting; to have The Graduate as a backdrop, as opposed to the formulaic girl gets guy, fakes it to the fiancÃ©e to fool the guy that she really wants and then she really doesn't get him. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but there's just so many ways you can tell a story."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every actor has horrible films, it's pretty much a given, and if these are truly her worst films, we think she's done relatively well for herself. We'll take a couple of terrible films for all of Aniston's really great films. I think we can all agree to never go near Leprechaun again, though.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Surprising Facts About Jennifer Aniston Pre-Fame</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqivsRmoZ6mnp6zpr6MmqWiq6Sku7R51qiprKxdm7atudJmmJybn6exqrrGZquoZZmisaN7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./these-are-the-only-hollywood-a-listers-who-are-billionaires.html>&#171;&nbsp;These Are The Only Hollywood A-listers Who Are Billionaires</a>
