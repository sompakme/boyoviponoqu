At the end of the century, James Franco and Seth Rogen became one of the most famous duos in comedic history. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not everyone is a fan of one of them</a>, they do have a lot of fans from all around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They have been working together for two decades and that shows how strong their friendship is, personally and professionally. There is a lot about them we don't know, but in terms of what we do know, they have maintained an incredible, hilarious, and surprisingly wholesome bond.</p><p>Here is everything we know about the friendship of James Franco and Seth Rogen.</p><h2 id=the-first-time-they-met><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>The First Time They Met</span></h2><p>The question we all ask regarding their relationship with one another is...how did they meet? Well, James and Seth both starred in a short-lived NBC comedy-drama called&nbsp;Freaks and Geeks. They were a part of the main cast and, based on behind the scenes photos, they hit it off immediately. Thankfully, they did not end their collaboration there!</p><h2 id=thus-a-bromance-is-born><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Thus, A Bromance Is Born</span></h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bromance between Seth Rogen and James Franco</a>&nbsp;is definitely the real thing. As the two were cast as cool kids, wasting time outside of class, their friendship evolved while the show progressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Freaks and Geeks got canceled after only one season, so what did the two do afterward? Aside from continuing to act in various projects separately, they would appear together in the 2007 film,&nbsp;Knocked Up, with James making a cameo. Seth was the leading man.</p><h2 id=poetic-methods><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Poetic Methods</span></h2><p>One of the most endearing things to know about James and Seth's friendship is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Franco wrote poems about their friendship</a>. When asked about if they were friends right away after meeting on the set of&nbsp;Freaks and Geeks, James admitted to writing the poems. If that is just not a cute way to express friendship to another person, we don't know what is.</p><h2 id=big-risk-takers><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Big Risk Takers</span></h2><p>When the time came for James and Seth to make a movie about encountering North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un, it was an incredibly bold move on the part of the two actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Interview&nbsp;led to threats. The film was downscaled to a limited theatrical release, which resulted in underwhelming box office performance. The film definitely excels in the comedy department, but the controversies made it underperform when it came to raking in cash.</p><h2 id=instagram-buddies><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Instagram Buddies</span></h2><p>Just how wholesome is this friendship? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Their</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagrams</a>&nbsp;have photos of them interacting outside of filming and those pics are just the best. They bring smiles, good times, and positive energy. It never hurts to see them hang out and be the best friends we know and love. In fact, we look forward to their posts!</p><h2 id=over-20-years-of-a-strong-friendship><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Over 20 Years Of A Strong Friendship</span></h2><p>With Seth and James knowing each other since 1999, their friendship has remained strong and great for a little over 20 years. That is a very long time to know someone, let alone be friends with someone.</p><p>It is honestly hard to imagine what it would be like if these two never became close. However, the odds of them drifting apart are really slim.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Tommy Wiseau’s The Room Will Always Be A Brilliant Disaster</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=masters-at-parody><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Masters At Parody</span></h2><p>When it comes to parody, look no further than Seth and James, who are kings of the genre. One of their famous gems is the music video parody of Kanye West's, "Bound 2." It is brilliantly titled, "Bound 3", and they even got praise for the hilarious take from the Chicago rapper himself. Kim Kardashian is also a fan.</p><h2 id=one-took-over-the-role-instead><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>One Took Over The Role Instead</span></h2><p>Even though Knocked Up was the first film they were in together, their first-ever collaboration on a film is Pineapple Express. Originally, Seth saw himself portraying Saul Silver. He imagined himself playing Saul while he wrote the script.</p><p>However, when a table read came around, he decided that James would be funnier for the role instead. Those that have seen the film can definitely agree to Seth was right about that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=too-focused-on-being-in-character><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Too Focused On Being In Character</span></h2><p>James Franco starred and directed in The Disaster Artist, which was based on a memoir made by Greg Sestero, who starred in The Room. Seth also appeared in the film in a minor role, but what happened behind the scenes was funny. Seth was having an ironically hard time being directed by James since Franco would stay in character as Tommy Wiseau, even while doing his director duties.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times Dave Franco And Alison Brie Were Couple GOALS</a></span></p><h2 id=standing-by-his-side><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Standing By His Side</span></h2><p>In 2018, James was under fire because of allegations made by a variety of women. He was accused of being inappropriate and too forceful, but has denied all claims.</p><p>When this occurred, we wondered what Seth thought of this whole ordeal. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth did not have the full picture but admitted to&nbsp;IndieWire</a> that he does not have a full answer, but that does not stop him from continuing to work with James.</p><h2 id=the-modern-comedic-duo><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Modern Comedic Duo</span></h2><p>There are many comedic duos throughout history, but we like to argue that James and Seth are the standouts. They have made impressive comedy films, ranging from parodies of themselves in fictional scenarios to adaptations of books while appearing in one of the most notorious films of all time. All we need is a sketch comedy show featuring them and we are all set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-continue-to-collaborate><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will Continue To Collaborate</span></h2><p>Despite knowing each other for a long time, they have done only one show together, but they've done eight movies together. They are definitely going to continue to make future projects together.</p><p>They have great chemistry and they know how to make us laugh, so whatever they come up with next, they will bring smiles and a good time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqWVqHqnvsCnmqhlkaOxbr%2FErZ9mqp%2Bcsq%2B%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./hallea-jones-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Hallea Jones Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
