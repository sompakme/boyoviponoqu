TV Might've Had Something To Do With It</a></span></p><h2 id=the-reason-stevie-wonder-filed-for-divorce>The Reason Stevie Wonder Filed For Divorce</h2><p>Stevie Wonder filed for divorce in August 2012, citing irreconcilable differences. No media outlet was able to gather more information. But documents released in public showed that the&nbsp;I Just Called to Say I Love You&nbsp;singer asked for joint custody of their sons, now ages 19 and 16. It was also indicated that Wonder signed an agreement to pay both child and spousal support and to split some assets. Many fans weren't happy to learn about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some fans argued that Wonder had already earned a great fortune way before meeting Millard. The singer-songwriter was a child prodigy who taught himself how to play various musical instruments like piano, the harmonica, and drums before he even turned 10. He was discovered by Ronnie White of The Miracles, a Motown band. Motown founder Berry Good Jr. immediately signed the young Wonder to a record deal after an audition.</p><p>In 1962, the&nbsp;Overjoyed&nbsp;singer released his instrumental album debut&nbsp;The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie Wonder.&nbsp;He was only 12 years old. Wonder then began to build&nbsp;his current net worth of $110 million. So the&nbsp;divorce was an understandable concern for his fans. Millard's net worth is estimated to be $1 million which already includes the child support they agreed on. The Grammy Hall of Famer must have had deep reasons for agreeing to support his ex-wife. Or he simply has plenty of money to share with the mother of his two sons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="'RHOBH' Cast Reacts To Co-Star Erika Jayne’s Impending Lawsuits & Unexpected Divorce" href=#>'RHOBH' Cast Reacts To Co-Star Erika Jayne’s Impending Lawsuits & Unexpected Divorce</a></span></p><h2 id=the-hefty-price-that-came-with-the-divorce>The Hefty Price That Came With The Divorce</h2><p>Wonder and Millard agreed to share custody of their kids. The pop icon was also asked to pay $25,000 a month in child support. Despite the headlines about how hefty of a price that was, Wonder never release any statement. Millard also didn't speak about the matter.&nbsp;By the time these details were revealed, Wonder was already dating his current wife. They met in 2010 following his separation from Millard. They tied the knot in 2017. Usher, John Legend, and Pharrell Williams were in the ceremony. They&nbsp;now have two children; Zaiah, 8, and Nia, 6.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer supports a total of 9 children with 5 different women.
