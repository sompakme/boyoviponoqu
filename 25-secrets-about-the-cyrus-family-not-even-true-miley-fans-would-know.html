a big family and most of them have the musical gene just like their dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. Miley has two sisters, Brandi and Noah, and two brothers, Trace and Braison. This family is not like any normal family as they're famous in Hollywood thanks to Miley's hit show Hannah Montana, but they're just like any family in regard to secrets and everyday life and the Cyrus family has a closet full of secrets which not even true fans of Miley's would know! First off, there is a half-brother named Christopher and there are only eight months between him and Miley. Billy Ray is Christopher's father and the family wants to keep that private as much as they can. According to reports, Tish and Billy would separate and get back together several times,&nbsp;and Tish loves rockers as her dating history consists of only rock stars. Plus, there's the whole possible scandal with Bret Michaels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy and Tish were also both married before getting together. Billy also blames Hannah Montana for a lot of things and Miley's relationship with Billy is uphill and downhill. Miley's past while growing up is questionable, especially her Bangerz albums days in 2013 until now. The superstar had issues with anxiety and Dysmorphia while filming Hannah Montana. Billy confesses his parenting&nbsp;ways revolves more around being a friend than a father&nbsp;and he wishes he would've been more responsible. Chase is in the band&nbsp;Metro Station and they've made a comeback after a long hiatus. Read on for more secrets the Cyrus family try their hardest to keep hidden from the world!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-half-brother><strong>The Half Brother</strong></h2><p>I bet you didn't know this before now about Miley's half-brother, Christopher, who is the same age as her. The family wants it to stay hidden and not include Christopher with the family during public outings, but Christopher has caught up with his half-siblings at home. Christopher's mom, Kristin Luckey, had a brief relationship with Billy when she was a waitress in South Carolina. The relationship between Christopher and Billy and the rest of the Cyrus clan is strained and he is disappointed about it, especially since he works hard and earned only about $7 an hour working at an electronics store when he was 17 and Miley was already earning millions by then. Christopher has come into contact with his sister after her concert in 2007.</p><p><strong><a href=#>“While she was on stage, </a></strong><strong>I was watching her from the sidelines. Afterward, we spent 20 minutes on her bus. Her voice is fantastic and I’m very proud of my sister.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Christopher, he and Miley got on well. “She was always really outgoing and good to be around. We used to play in the game room where there’s a pool table, jukebox, toys, and gaming systems.” Kristen says the secrecy, in most cases, hurts Christopher especially since they keep him hidden. “Chris reaches out to have a relationship, but it’s been months since they engaged. No one acknowledges his birthday or even Christmas for him." There's no news about the half-brother nowadays, so this may try to stay hidden for a long time.</p><h2 id=billy-adopted-trace-and-brandi><strong>Billy Adopted Trace And Brandi</strong></h2><p>Brandi and Trace Cyrus are actually Miley's half-brother and half-sister as Tish was married before Billy and the country singer adopted Trace and Brandi when they were kids and that's why they're a huge part of the family. Brandi even used to refer to herself as&nbsp;<a href=#>"the forgotten Cyrus child."</a> Brandi and Trace even took on Billy's last name and don't seem to have a relationship with their biological father&nbsp;since nothing is mentioned in the news. It's almost like he doesn't exist. Brandi even calls Billy dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>"I don't know what it is, </a></strong><strong>but I remember when I was a kid and my dad was at the height of his success, all people wanted to do was make fun of me for it. I was like, 'Wait a minute. My dad is the biggest star on the planet and you want to make fun of me?'"</strong></p><p>The close unit is a tight-knit family and even though Miley, Noah, and Braison have half-siblings, they include them and don't even see them as anything else. As Tish says, <a href=#>"Our family is everything to me, my kids, and I'm proud of the family and the relationship, and how hard we've worked," she shared. "We've publicly gone through stuff and made it work. And I'm so glad that we did, because our family so strong and so amazing. I'm blessed."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mommy-cyrus-has-a-thing-for-rockers><strong>Mommy Cyrus Has A Thing For Rockers</strong></h2><p>Tish seems to love dating musicians especially rockers as she's been linked to them romantically and friendship. Before Billy, Tish was married to a drummer, Baxter Neal Helson. <a href=#>Tish and Baxter grew up together</a> and after falling in love were married before getting a divorce as Billy Ray came into the picture who is a musician with the smash hit, "Achy Breaky Heart." Tish admits they met at a bar, therefore, it seems Tish was a roadie, a term used for people who hang out with musicians, mainly rock stars. Tish said she used to be fun and that Billy was attracted to her because of her habits. <a href=#>"I’ve never seen you drink, ever, and I think that’s so </a>cool." Tish says she tamed Billy even though she had more fun after they started dating.</p><p><a href=#>Tish's friendship with rocker Bret Michaels</a> brought crossfire to the family as rumors of a relationship started circulating and Billy filed for divorce after the rumors were made public. A source said Bret was friends with the family as he and Miley even did a duet together, "Nothing to Lose."&nbsp;Tish was seen at Bret's concert in 2010 and was even asked to help adapt his book, Roses & Thorns, into a movie as Tish has a production company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tish-and-billy-s-first-marriages><strong>Tish And Billy's First Marriages</strong></h2><p>There's hardly any information about mom and dad Cyrus first marriages as it's so secretive that it's really hard getting any information at all. The only information about Tish's first marriage to the drummer, Baxter Neal Helson is the fact that they<a href=#> grew up together and were childhood sweethearts.</a> After dating for several years they got married but it didn't last long because of Tish controversies of an affair. Tish and Baxter got married when Tish was 19 and Brandi was born when she was 20. Baxter wants to remain out of the media and that's why information about their marriage and divorce is free from the media.</p><p><strong>Baxter has said<a href=#> he never wants to see or meet Tish again.</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy's first marriage was to&nbsp;a songwriter, Cindy Smith and all information are void from the Internet as well. <a href=#>Billy and Cindy were married between 1986 and 1991</a>. They didn't have children and the split was apparently due to Billy's bumpy road to success. Billy was one busy man&nbsp;since after his split he began a relationship with Christopher, his son's, mom, Kristin, and then met Tish soon after that. This couple doesn't want us to know about their previous failed marriages since it's so secretive!</p><h2 id=miley-was-bullied><strong>Miley Was Bullied</strong></h2><p>The pop star didn't have the best teenage years like we expect she would've since she was so famous, but it's far from the truth as Miley experienced bullying due to bad acne and&nbsp; ended up experiencing depression because of it.&nbsp;<a href=#>"I went through a time where I was really depressed. </a><a href=#>Like, I locked myself in my room and my dad had to break my door down."</a> Miley even opened up about her bullying days in her book called&nbsp;Miles To Go. During Miley's pre-teen years and while growing up in Tennessee, things got out of hand. <a href=#>"The girls took it beyond normal bullying. These were big, tough girls. I was scrawny and short. They were fully capable of doing me bodily harm."</a>&nbsp;Miley admits what the girls would do to her. "They shoved me in. I was trapped. I banged on the door until my fists hurt. Nobody came," she writes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I spent what felt like an hour in there, waiting for someone to rescue me, wondering how my life had gotten so messed up."</strong></p><p>The girls also teased Miley about Billy. "Your dad's a one-hit wonder. You'll never amount to anything — just like him." Miley says she came through it as she also felt depressed after a breakup. “I lay in bed at night by myself and I’m totally&nbsp;okay and that’s so much stronger than the person three years ago who would have thought they would have died if they didn’t have a boyfriend.”</p><h2 id=not-so-clean-image><strong>Not-So-Clean Image</strong></h2><p>Everyone thinks Miley began her bad-girl image in 2013, although this is not true since she started doing questionable things when she was 15. Before twerking, tongue poses, and wearing promiscuous and quirky outfits, Miley was in the tabloids, and not in a good way, when she did a photoshoot for Vanity Fair in 2008. Miley bared her back with a satin bedsheet wrapped around her. Fans were enthralled with this image since she was supposed to be a squeaky-clean Disney star. Miley had to apologize, <a href=#>"I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be 'artistic' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed," she said. "I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another incident in 2008 was when Miley's phone was hacked and images were released and portrayed her as anything but clean&nbsp;since the photos were very revealing. Miley was linked to a guy who was five years her senior at the time. When asked during an interview if Miley was allowed to date him, she replied,&nbsp;<a href=#>“Yes, but I just think that right now, everything is really good so I haven’t been really answering the question much."</a> The only reason why it was controversial is&nbsp;because Miley was 15 at the time.</p><h2 id=the-relationships><strong>The&nbsp;Relationships</strong></h2><p>In 2010, the press went crazy with reports about Tish and Bret Michael's having a relationship, but it was only speculation. The rumors arose after Billy and Tish's separation, but Tish's reps confirmed it wasn't true.<a href=#> "It's not true. They had a working relationship."</a> Bret's rep also spoke out, “He has been a close friend of the family for some time and has worked with Miley. Tish, Miley, and Bret have worked on several professional projects together over the last year and that is it." Miley and Bret were supposed to release a duet "Every Rose Has Its Thorn," which was put on hold, though, because of the speculations, but it was released not long after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>"The record label was supposed have to this huge humongous release of 'Every Rose.' It was going to be Miley's next-step song, but because of that, they stepped back."</a></strong></p><p>Tish wasn't the only one to be in the media for an alleged&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;as Billy also fell prey to it when it was speculated that Billy was having an affair with Dylis Croman. She acted with Billy in 2012 on the Broadway show Chicago. What makes it even stranger is the fact that Miley tweeted this to Billy:&nbsp;<a href=#>'@billyraycyrus since you won't reply to my texts, I'm giving you an hour to tell the truth or I’ll tell it for you.</a>"&nbsp;Miley even pictured the tweet with a picture of her and an unidentified woman. Both rumored&nbsp;relationships were never admitted, but I guess we will never know what actually happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-s-parenting-style><strong>Billy's Parenting Style</strong></h2><p>Their father has come clean about his parenting and admits in an interview with <a href=#>GQ</a> that he should've been a better father. "How many interviews did I give and say, 'You know what's important between me and Miley is I try to be a friend to my kids.' I said it a lot. And sometimes, I would even read about other parents that might say, 'You don't need to be a friend, you need to be a parent.' Well, I'm the first guy to say to them right now, 'You were right.' I should have been a better parent." Billy also admits that he wasn't good at disciplining his kids. Miley's questionable doings since she was 15 such as partying, photoshoot scandals, and promiscuous behaviour is evidence of things getting out of hand. When images of Miley partying too much were released in 2010, Billy took to Twitter to apologize.</p><p><strong><a href=#>"Sorry guys. I had no idea. Just saw this stuff for the first time myself. I'm so sad. There is much beyond my control right now."</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy was with Miley constantly during the Hannah Montana days and Miley blames that&nbsp;for&nbsp;her twerking days. <a href=#>"So that was a lot of time spent, dad and grandma, which is why when I turned 18, you wondered why I was twerking at the Juicy J show. I just spent 10 years everyday with my dad and grandma. I had to break free."</a></p><h2 id=noah-acting-like-miley><strong>Noah Acting Like Miley</strong></h2><p>The youngest of the children is all grown up now as Noah is entering the music world with her latest hits, but when she was 14, Noah was already under the influence of Miley. In 2014, Noah was spotted with Miley in Spain and they were reportedly clubbing. The source said, <a href=#>“She doesn't hold anything back. She parties and curses in front of her. Noah stays up until the wee hours with her.”</a> Noah even dressed in a body suit with Miley during a Bangerz performance and the source says Noah could possibly become like Miley. “At this point, Noah is a teenage trainwreck in the making, thanks to her sister.” Noah even talks about partying in her song, "Stay Together."&nbsp;Noah sings about memories of partying, yelling at the DJ, laughing at jokes, and breaking her phone on the sidewalk. Noah also says in one line, <a href=#>"Doing things that I will not regret until the morning."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017 Noah was a guest at Miley's controversial birthday party for Liam and Noah who turned 17 at the time. The theme is the substance abuse which Miley was famous for doing and guest Ashley Greene shared on her social media about the night, <a href=#>"things got a little crazy last night." </a>Hopefully, Noah will be tamer than Miley.</p><h2 id=billy-s-one-hit-wonder><strong>Billy's One-Hit Wonder</strong></h2><p>We all know about the song "Achy Breaky Heart"&nbsp;since it's so popular and it's also become known as a joke. Even though a few people turned the song down because of the title, Billy wanted it.<a href=#> "Once I got a hold of it, I never let that song out of my grasp. I loved it. And I knew Joe was right. It was going to be a hit."</a> Although the song ranked number two on VH1's 50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever, it launched Billy's career and it's been translated into 100 languages and featured in TV&nbsp;shows such as The Simpsons and South Park. Plus, it was the first country single to go platinum a decade after Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton's "Islands in the Stream." It's the only hit underneath Billy's name even though he has developed other albums,&nbsp;<a href=#>but they didn't do as well</a> and the other Billboard hits were Hannah Montana duets with Miley.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy Ray decided to release the second version of "Achy Breaky Heart," this time including rap with Buck 22 who does the most part and the song mainly includes rapping. <a href=#>The video is plain weird</a> with Larry King being included and aliens! The video is doing well on YouTube as it has over four million hits.</p><h2 id=tish-and-billy-s-rollercoaster-relationship><strong>Tish And Billy's Rollercoaster Relationship</strong></h2><p>This couple has been together for over 20 years and during that time, they've filed for divorce about three times but then called it off and remained together. In 2010, this statement was made jointly.<a href=#> "As you can imagine, this is a very difficult time for our family. We are trying to work through some personal matters. We appreciate your thoughts and prayers."</a> In 2011, Tish and Billy got back together after Billy filed a request to withdraw his divorce petition on March 11, 2011, but in 2013, the couple called it quits again. Billy Ray filed for the divorce and according to Tish's petition, it was due to&nbsp;<a href=#>irreconcilable differences</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A longtime friend of the family, Ken Baker, told <a href=#>E News</a> that they got back together a second time. "I spoke to Tish and she told me they both woke up and realized they love each other and decided they want to stay together," Baker said.</p><p><strong>"They recently went to couple’s therapy, something they hadn't done in 22 years of being together, and it's brought them closer together and it really opened up their communication in amazing ways."</strong></p><p>Last year, divorce was on the cards once again, but it was dismissed and they've been posing on each other's social media. These two may just be on and off for years to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-s-personal-struggles><strong>Miley's Personal Struggles</strong></h2><p>In 2013, the world was shocked by how much Miley changed and the change is known as her Bangerz days. The singer went pixie short, platinum blonde and wasn't dating Liam anymore. Miley also started twerking and sticking her tongue out.&nbsp;Miley was also scene often times under the influence.&nbsp;This year, things started changing as Miley ditched her previous lifestyle for a cleaner and more sober one. <a href=#>"I’m not doing anything, I’m not drinking, I’m completely clean right now! That was just something that I wanted to do.”</a> That's not the only thing that has been transformed since her music has gone back to her old country roots and she's growing back her hair. Billy is also happy that Miley has quit that lifestyle.</p><p><strong><a href=#>“I think she just found… she’s firing off all cylinders. Her thoughts, her instincts, everything is at the top of its game. Sometimes, you have to clear out the junk and then you realize what’s most important. Whatever is going on, it’s working for her.”</a></strong></p><p>Billy was even concerned that Miley was turning into Kurt Cobain in regards to <a href=#>spiralling out of control</a> and having no help, but thankfully, Miley is getting her life back on track.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-blames-hannah-montana-for-miley-s-behaviour><strong>Billy Blames Hannah Montana For Miley's Behaviour</strong></h2><p>The pop star was a young teen when she began her role as Hannah on the hit Disney show and Miley instantly became famous. Billy was Miley's co-star as he played her father but now Billy is coming clean about how it ruined their lives. <a href=#>"Oh, it's huge — it destroyed my family. I'll tell you right now — the show destroyed my family."</a> Billy made this statement after he started noticing that Miley was growing up to fast. Billy didn't attend Miley's 18th because he thought it was to grown up. "It was wrong," he explained. "It was for 21 years old and up. Once again ,all them people, they all wanted me to fly out so that then when all the bad press came, they could say, 'Daddy endorsed this stuff.'"</p><p>Billy wants to stay out of his daughter's wild behaviour because of what the press would say. 'This whole thing's falling apart up there and they just want to blame all this stuff on you again. I'm staying out of it."

I'd erase it all in a second if I could."</p><h2 id=miley-and-billy-s-relationship><strong>Miley And Billy's Relationship</strong></h2><p>As mentioned in a previous&nbsp;entry, Billy blames Hannah Montana for everything that went wrong with his family and in 2011, Bill said he's working on mending his family. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“My family is the most important thing I have and we are working together to make sure our future is stronger and healthier.”</a> In 2013, Miley reunited with her dad at the Teen Choice Awards with Noah. Miley gave him a hug and leaned on his shoulder as Billy was there to support her during her speech. In June, Miley&nbsp;and her&nbsp;dad were a bit estranged&nbsp;since&nbsp;she was there for Tish and Noah after the divorce news hit the media&nbsp;— a divorce which never happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley also posted the tweet in regard to Billy and his Chicago co-star which was mentioned on a previous&nbsp;entry, but the tweet was instantly deleted. Miley seemed to want to start a Twitter war with Billy&nbsp; since she also tweeted, <a href=#>"Since your texts and email obviously aren't working, would you like to talk like this?"</a> Billy still didn't reply. Miley was apparently mad, but when her parents got back together in July a month later, she patched things up with Billy. Miley still loves her dad&nbsp;and last year, she even got a tattoo in his honor titled<a href=#> 'Dad.'</a></p><h2 id=braison-s-modelling-woes><strong>Braison's Modelling Woes</strong></h2><p>Miley stirred the pot for her youngest brother while congratulating his first runway job with Dolce & Gabbana. Miley went on saying modelling was never Braison's dream as Miley said he is one of the best musicians she knows. Miley continued on congratulating Braison and then went on to say.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>"P.S. D&G, I&nbsp;strongly disagree with your politics, but I do support your company’s effort to celebrate young artists, giving them the platform to shine their light for all to see!”</a></strong></p><p>The popular fashion company responded and weren't happy at all. “We are Italian and we don’t care about politics and mostly neither about the American one! We make dresses and if you think about doing politics with a post, it’s simply ignorant." It could've cost Braison's job as the company was even thinking of firing him thanks to Miley's message.</p><p>There's not much news about Braison in the media since he took a different route then the rest of his family. Before the runway incident, <a href=#>Braison was making a name for himself</a> when he was 18 by signing with Wilhelmina Models, the agency Kylie and Kendall Jenner are also signed with. Braison did his first photo shoot for Troix magazine. Braison also took classes at Pasadena School of the Arts and his only musical debut is being a part of a local Los Angeles band.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anxiety-issues><strong>Anxiety Issues</strong></h2><p>Miley has come clean about her battle with anxiety attacks, especially in regard to Liam. <a href=#>"When I went through a really intense breakup, you know, I was engaged and when I was with Liam or when I was on Disney,</a></p><p><strong><a href=#>the thing that gave me the most anxiety was not knowing what to do with myself when Disney wasn’t there to carry me anymore or if I didn't have him."</a></strong></p><p>As mentioned in a previous&nbsp;entry, Miley also experienced depression from the breakup and the bullying, but Miley says she's fine now. "Now I'm free of both of those things, and I'm fine." That's not the only reasons for Miley's anxiety attacks as Hannah Montana played a big part as well. When Miley was 11, she had to play a 16-year-old and she experienced anxiety attacks as well as hot flashes because of it. <a href=#>"Meanwhile, I'm this fragile little girl playing a 16-year-old in a wig and a ton of makeup. It was like Toddlers & Tiaras."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley isn't the only one who experienced anxiety. Her brother Trace has also experienced anxiety and panic attacks. Trace had to cancel his tour in Canada because of it. In an Instagram post, Trace apologized to his fans and explained the situation due to being questioned by officials at the border. <a href=#>"I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks and the idea of being detained in a room against my will is just something I can't handle mentally right now."</a></p><h2 id=a-heart-condition><strong>A Heart Condition</strong></h2><p>Did you know that Miley has a heart condition? Well, she does and Miley has had it since birth. The condition is called supraventricular tachycardia, a heart condition that can cause an abnormal resting heart rate. Miley still has it and in 2014, Miley&nbsp;ended up in the hospital for it after experiencing an allergic reaction to antibiotics. Doctors were concerned about Miley's health during her partying days as it seemed Miley was ignoring the health issues. Dr. Mark Urman said, <a href=#>"She could get heart muscle problems and even heart failure at worst</a>. She could even end up with a stroke."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2009, Miley was open about her health issues in her Miles To Go memoir: "My heart rate increases a lot just from going up a flight of stairs. There is never a time onstage when I'm not thinking about my heart." Miley also admits she was born with a hole in her heart and admits that it doesn't hurt.&nbsp;<a href=#>"The type of tachycardia I have isn't dangerous. It won't hurt me, but it does bother me."</a> Sources say that partying as hard as she did&nbsp;isn't suggested, especially with Miley's condition, but Miley did it anyway. Now that Miley is sober, her heart could be healthier and may have no future complications.</p><h2 id=trace-is-in-a-band><strong>Trace Is In A Band</strong></h2><p>Miley's fame is more well known than her older brother Trace, but Trace is in a band called Metro Station and it's doing well in the music industry as they have<a href=#> three number-one hits on the Billboard hot charts</a>. The band's accomplishments consist of a number-one hit on the Hot 100, a number one for the Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart and a number one on the top 10 album on the Alternative Albums chart. Trace is the lead singer and after having a number of hits, the band called it quits in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>"The band just kind of slowly started falling apart. We lost the keyboard player when I was on tour with my sister Miley. We let go of our drummer during that tour; it was down to me and Mason."</a></strong></p><p>A two-man band wouldn't work which is what led to the decision. "I think that when you have two people and you go from a four-piece band to a two-piece, it’s kind of the typical rock and roll story. Where you have a lot of success and, you know, you get into an argument, and things just kind of fall apart." After the split, Trace started a new band called Ashland High and the band released two albums and played Allentown’s former Crocodile Rock Cafe. Now Metro Station is back together and making music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-isn-t-shy><strong>Miley Isn't Shy&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We all know that Miley is with Liam, but what you may not know is that Miley has come out as pansexual.<a href=#> "My whole life, I didn't understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word 'bisexual,' because that's even putting me in a box. I don't ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl." </a>Miley says her first relationship was with a girl and at first, Tish and Billy didn't understand. "Even at that time, when my parents didn't understand, I just felt that one day they are going to understand." Tish has come to terms with it though and apologized to Miley.</p><p><strong><a href=#>"My mom started crying. She was like, 'I'm so sorry about the way I was when you were that age and coming out.' She never understood me until she saw that girl who couldn't be herself. It was very cool."</a></strong></p><p>Miley made this statement when she was dating: "I'm 22, I'm going on dates, but I change my style every two weeks, let alone who I'm with. I'm very open about it; I'm pansexual. But I'm not in a relationship." Miley even started a foundation called Happy Hippie which helps homelessness and an LGBTQ youth at risk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-lived-in-his-car><strong>Billy Lived In His Car</strong></h2><p>Can you imagine the country singer being homeless and having to live in his car? It's hard to picture since Billy has a lot of money now and his family is pretty famous, but before making it big with "Achy Breaky Heart,"&nbsp;Billy was struggling. Billy resided in his Chevy.<a href=#> "I was pretty comfortable in there. There were cassette tapes, and tapes, and tapes. And guitars, and microphones rolling around the floor. If I needed anything, all my stuff was in that car. That was my office."</a> Then Billy produced his first album with Mercury Records and things started to change. Billy said it was tough though.&nbsp;<a href=#>“It wasn’t pretty.”</a> Billy even recorded the hit song in his car. <a href=#>"I lived in my car and was homeless when I originally recorded this song, so it's all a blessing to me. I feel really fortunate."</a> Thankfully, the song became a hit! Now Billy lives on a 500-acre farm in Tennessee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>“I feel really lucky.”</a> Billy made this statement in regard to his family and fortune, especially after living it rough for a while. The farm includes six horses, a cow, many dogs, and a zebra donkey called Eeyore. Even though the family is scattered in Los Angeles and elsewhere, the property is still seen as home. Braison said, “It’s home base. Like when stuffs going down, come here.”</p><h2 id=miley-s-issues-from-hannah-montana><strong>Miley's Issues&nbsp;From&nbsp;Hannah Montana</strong></h2><p>The singer became self-conscious about her body after the hit Disney show because of how she was treated.<a href=#> "I was told what a girl is supposed to be.</a> I was made to look like someone that I wasn't and then, when I wasn't on that show, it was like, 'Who am I?'" Miley said she also had no say in what to wear and look like, so Miley developed dysmorphia which is a mental illness with an obsessive focus on a flaw in the body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"From the time I was 11, it was, 'You're a pop star! That means you have to be blonde and you have to have long hair, and you have to put on some glittery tight thing.'"</strong></p><p>A lot of issues arose because of her role as Hannah. During her wild days, after a while, people just started expecting Miley to be wild, but it wasn't about that, so she changed her ways again. <a href=#>“I didn’t want to show up to photo shoots and be the girl who would stick out my tongue. In the beginning, it was kind of like saying, 'Girls, should be able to have this freedom or whatever.’ But it got to a point where I did feel sexualized.”</a> Miley has always been told what to wear and what to do. “People were so shocked by some of the things that I did. It should be more shocking that when I was 11 or 12, I was put in full hair and makeup, a wig, and told what to wear by a group of mostly older men." This led to Miley's downfall as she didn't know who she was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stuck-between-her-family-and-liam><strong>Stuck Between Her Family And Liam</strong></h2><p>Miley's protective brother, Trace, seems to have a problem with Liam which causes problems, especially since Miley's in the middle. According to a source,<a href=#> "He doesn't approve of Liam."</a> Trace even said Liam is lazy. Miley wants Trace to give Liam a chance. "Miley values his opinion, but she's told him he's got the whole situation all wrong. She loves Liam and wants her brother to as well." Trace isn't the only problem&nbsp;since L<a href=#>iam and Trish also seem to knock heads and don't see eye to eye</a>.&nbsp;The showdown between mom and fiancé occurred in Malibu at a members-only exclusive club called Soho Beach House. One witness confessed it was a major fight with yelling and it became so intense, Miley and Liam left while Tish stayed on.</p><p>Another witness said Tis, yelled, “You have no authority in this family” and “You can’t take my daughter away from me.” Liam was furious and yelled that Tish ruined it every time they wanted to have a nice day out and that she is an embarrassment. Miley reportedly said. “I can’t put up with this woman anymore.” It appears Miley sticks by Liam and doesn't take her family's side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=obsession-with-tattoos><strong>Obsession With Tattoos</strong></h2><p>This family has a weird need to cover their body with ink,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;Miley and Trace. Miley has a number of tattoos including a weird one and they are on her fingers, underneath her feet, or on&nbsp;her arms. <a href=#>The tattoos include a moon, a cat, an avocado, a planet, and a dancing man all etched on her arms.</a> Miley also has the words "just breathe" on her rib cage and the weirdest one yet is her Vegemite tattoo which is an Australian food staple. Trace, on the other hand, is completely covered in tattoos. Even his fingertips are tattooed plus the side of his face. He even has tattoos on one side of his head.&nbsp;Trace said he loves art and that's why he has so many.</p><p><strong><a href=#>"One of the things I love in life is art. That's one reason my entire body is covered in tattoos."</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The whole family has tattoos.&nbsp;<a href=#>Billy has a full sleeve tattoo on his right arm and a tattoo on his left arm. Tish has angel wings on her back and flowers on her abdomen</a>. <a href=#>Brandi has seven tattoos with two on her knuckles</a> and <a href=#>Braison has a medium sized tattoo on his forearm</a> which he got in Melbourne, Australia. <a href=#>Noah has just recently joined the family with more than three </a>tattoos.</p><h2 id=miley-s-name-change><strong>Miley's Name Change</strong></h2><p>Miley Cyrus is a household name, but funny enough, it's not the name she was given at birth. Her name was Destiny Hope and in 2008, she officially changed her name to Miley. It was done <a href=#>“to make her commonly used name the same as her legal name.”</a> But why did Miley change it? It was because of Billy.</p><p><strong><a href=#>“As a baby, she just kept smiling all the time. So her name was Destiny Hope, but I started calling her Smiley. Then as you start talking to a baby, you start dropping the S off the front end, and pretty soon, Smiley became Miley.”</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley chose <a href=#>Ray as her second name because she wanted to honor her </a>father's middle name. Billy Ray chose Miley's old name. "My name was Destiny Hope when I was born because my dad said it was my destiny to bring hope to the world." Miley ended up becoming her legal name. "She was never referred to as Destiny Hope, ever since childhood, she has been Miley Ray and the family wanted her common name to be her legal name." Thank goodness she did because it wouldn't be the same with the name Destiny Hope.</p><h2 id=braces-for-miley><strong>Braces For Miley</strong></h2><p>During a Hannah Montana break, Miley had braces, but when filming started, the singer had to have them removed&nbsp;since they didn't fit Hannah's character.<a href=#> "I had to take them off immediately because of the way I looked." </a>Miley admits she didn't know how to feel about it. If I was me now, I would have been like,</p><p><strong>"Normal 14-year-olds have braces. I’m going to have braces on the show, so kids who have braces in real life know that’s okay.’ But I didn’t have that in my mind then."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Therefore, Miley had to wear them in secrecy to fit Hannah's character. To do this,&nbsp;<a href=#>Miley wore lingual braces behind her teeth</a> and that's not all&nbsp;since Miley also reportedly got porcelain veneers for a better smile. In 2009, Miley confessed to Elle that she loved her crooked teeth. <a href=#>"I like these crooked. I love my teeth. My dad won't let me fix my teeth or cut my hair. He loves it. He's like, `It's you!'"</a> In 2015, Miley had dental problems, though,&nbsp;since she had five of her teeth removed and Miley also had<a href=#> veneers on her teeth</a>. Ouch! Even celebrities can't escape the dentist or posing on the red carpet with braces, but now Miley has a perfect smile which fits her nickname.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>References: Daily Mail.co.uk, Elle.com, Twist Magazine.com, Lifeandstylemag.com, Stealherstyle,net, People.com, The Inquistr.com, News.com.au, Cosmopolitan.com, The Boot.com, Rollingstone.com, E Online.com, Mcall.com, Billboard.com, Mtv.com, HollywoodLife.com, Mirror.co.uk, Us Magazine.com, GQ.com, ETOnline.com, Countryliving.com, Alloy.com, TMZ.com, Accessonline.com, Independent.co.uk, Ninjajournalist.com, Frostsnow.com, Articlebio.com, Foxnews.com, and Girlfriend.com.au.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmp6tLHCq5ytq12Wr7DB02aroZ1dmMazwdJmnZqlmaHGbrrOrWSerpWjerW%2B1J5kpqGcmsZussCnqmavn6q5pXnKp6awZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./a-peek-inside-chris-evans-3-5-million-laurel-canyon-mansion.html>&#171;&nbsp;A Peek Inside Chris Evans' $3.5 Million Laurel Canyon Mansion</a>
