Picking quality shampoos and conditioners specifically made for dyed hair is essential for maintaining your hair color between salon visits and keeping your hair and scalp healthy. For anyone looking to protect and enhance their colored hair, we’ve researched the many products on the market and compiled a list of the best shampoos and conditioners for colored hair.</p><h2><strong>Why Colored Hair Needs Specific Shampoos and Conditioners</strong></h2><p>Shampoos and conditioners made for colored hair help you extend the life of your dye job by effectively cleansing the hair and scalp without lifting color molecules – but the benefits don’t stop there. They also work to ensure your hair stays as healthy and strong as possible. Dyes can weaken the strands and cause damage, making it look and feel unhealthy in the long run (if not properly taken care of). This means your hair may be more prone to breakage, split ends and dryness. Color-friendly shampoos and conditioners are made to give your mane the support it needs to stay soft, smooth, nourished and resilient.</p><h2><strong>What to Look For in a Shampoo and Conditioner for Colored Hair</strong></h2><p>The best shampoos and conditioners for colored hair will contain ingredients that defend against color fade. Using formulas that repair damage and strengthen the strands is also important. Ingredients like biotin, proteins (such as hydrolyzed jojoba, barley and wheat proteins) and keratin are all great for fortifying color-treated strands, ensuring they are more resilient and less prone to future damage.</p><p>Last but not least, replenishing moisture levels is essential to fight against the drying effects of dyes. Hyaluronic acid, glycerin, squalane, avocado oil, shea butter, argan oil and coconut oil are some of our favorite ingredients for moisturizing dry hair.</p><p>There are also certain ingredients you should avoid in your shampoos and conditioners. We recommend avoiding formulas with harsh sulfates, as they can strip dye, making your hair color look dull. They can also be aggressive on the strands and scalp, making them dry and irritated. Since color-treated hair is already prone to dryness, you’ll want to avoid any ingredients that may remove natural moisture.</p><p>Additionally, you should avoid using formulas (particularly shampoos) to clarify the hair to deep clean and remove buildup. These types of formulas – which are generally supposed to be used once a week or less – often have sulfates, and can be harsh on the strands, stripping away color and moisture.</p><h2><strong>How to Maintain Your Hair Color</strong></h2><p>Besides using the right products when you wash and condition your hair, there are some things you can do to make your color treatment last as long as possible.</p><ul><li><strong>Wait Before Showering After Coloring</strong>: Right after you color your hair, the best thing you can do is wait at least 72 hours before washing it with shampoo. After dyeing, it takes this amount of time for the hair cuticles to close and seal in the color molecule, and for the color to set completely. Waiting before you shampoo will give your hair the best chance of holding on to that color for the longest possible time.</li><li><strong>Limit How Often You Wash</strong>: You may be using color-safe products, but that doesn’t mean you should be washing your hair every day, as doing so can cause dryness and damage. Give yourself some time between washes to allow your natural oils to condition the hair. Washing your hair two to three times a week is ideal. If you need a refresh between washes, reach for a dry shampoo.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Avoid Hot Showers</strong>: As comforting as they may be (especially when the weather is cold), super-hot showers can have a major impact on your hair color. Stick to lukewarm showers to maintain your color as long as possible.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Protect Your Hair Against Heat</strong>: If possible, avoid using hot tools as much as possible, as they can dull your color and cause damage to hair that color treatments have already weakened. However, if you need hot tools, be sure to use as low a temperature setting as possible, and always use a heat protectant to defend your hair.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Block Your Hair From Direct Sun Exposure</strong>: Do your best to avoid exposing your hair to direct sunlight, which can fade color. If you’ll spend lots of time in the sun, wear a hat to protect your hair from harmful UV rays.</li><li aria-level=1><strong>Avoid the Pool</strong>: Chlorine can cause hair color to fade, so it’s best to stay out of the pool if possible. Of course, we’re not saying you should skip out on the fun on your next vacation. If you do plan on spending some time in the pool, bring along a leave-in conditioner to apply before and after diving in. This can help moisturize and protect your hair to reduce the risk of fading.</li></ul><h2><strong>The Best Shampoos and Conditioners for Colored Hair&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Without further ado, let’s turn to our guide to the best shampoos and conditioners for colored hair.
