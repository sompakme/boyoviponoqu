this year.&nbsp; Brady has had the fortune of being able <a href=#>play in his 40s</a>, which a feat not many NFL players have accomplished.He is also winning outside the game of football with his business ventures. During his tenure with the Patriots, there were rumors that he was<a href=#> displeased with his salary</a> compared to other quarterbacks. If that is indeed true, he made the money he missed out on through other avenues and clearly has a life after the NFL already planned out. Here are five sources of income for Tom Brady outside of football.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tb12>TB12</h2><p>The TB12 way has been mantra of Tom Brady in recent years and he's turned it into a successful business. That is to be expected when head of the brand is arguably playing better in his 40s then his 20s. When people see Brady succeeding with this method, they believe following it can help them in their field. On the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TB12 website</a>, it explains that their goal is "to help you do what you love better and for longer."</p><p>TB12 offers body training services either virtually or in person. There are currently three in person locations including Boston, Foxboro and Tampa Bay, cities that Brady has become familiar with during his NFL career. Asides from that, people can buy merchandise like shirts, hats, hoodies and supplements. Plus there's articles giving tips on how to improve diets, physical health, lessons to learn from Tom Brady and recipes for meals he eats.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Brady's Former Boston Condo Is Listed for Almost $7 Billion</a></span></p><h2 id=opponents-on-the-field-teammates-off-it>Opponents on the Field, Teammates off it</h2><p>Although they were opponents in Super Bowl 44, they are teammates on this business venture. NFL Hall of Famer, New York Giants legend and successful TV anchor, Michael Strahan is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working with Tom Brady </a>on a sports media company called Religion of Sports.</p><p>This past August, the company got financial support by receiving $10 million from companies such as Courtside Ventures, LinkinFirm, Advancit Capital and Elysian Park. Religion of Sports CEO, Ameeth Sankaran said, "Our stories answer the question ‘Why sports matter’ and delve into deeper human and emotional storytelling." So the company has produced the Facebook Watch documentary about Tom Brady's training during the offseason and other documentaries about NBA superstar Stephen and sprint gold medalist Usian Bolt to mention a few. Whenever Brady decides to hang it up, don't be surprised if the Religion of Sports produces a few more documentaries about him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=autograph>Autograph</h2><p>Not that kind of autograph, it's a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFT (non-fungible token) company </a>that Brady has founded and launched along with&nbsp;Richard Rosenblatt. Autograph will have digital artists collaborate with famous figures&nbsp;in sports, entertainment, fashion and pop culture to create collectables. Rosenblatt said, "Autograph will bring together some of the world's most iconic names and brands with best in class digital artists to ideate, create and launch NFTs and ground-breaking experiences to a community of fans and collectors."&nbsp;Brady has a solid team of advisors behind him such as LA Dodgers and Golden State Warriors owner Peter Guber,&nbsp;Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer,Cameo CEO Steven Galanis, Draft Kings CEO&nbsp;Jason Robins and co-founder&nbsp;Paul Liberman most notably.&nbsp;It is still in the beginning stages, but the potential is infinite. Considering the star studded staff at Autograph, it shouldn't take much convincing for A list celebrities to collaborate with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=real-estate>Real Estate</h2><p>With the luxury being a star athlete offers, many decide to own multiple homes in different&nbsp;cities. So when someone like Tom Brady wants to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sell one of his houses</a>, it's guaranteed that the bidding price will be a high one. In 2014, he sold his Los Angeles mansion to Dr. Dre, one of the richest artists in rap music, for $40 million. In New York, his luxury condo is worth $20 million and Yellowstone Club is $4 million along with it's other charges to join the club and&nbsp;other fees.&nbsp;Expect there to be&nbsp;more real estate investments from Brady when he retires.</p><h2 id=199-productions>199 Productions</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brady launched 199 Productions</a> last year, which is a company&nbsp;that will create documentaries, movies and TV shows.&nbsp;The number 199 is extremely significant to him as he was selected&nbsp;as the 199 overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft. Something he used as a chip on his shoulder to motivate him to become an all time great NFL player. One of 199 Productions first projects will be a documentary about overlooked&nbsp;aspects in the game of football called Unseen Football.&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame directors Anthony and Joe Russo will play a role in the creation of this documentary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>For The Brand: The Highest Paid Athlete Endorsements</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TB12</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Business</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money Inc</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBsLmMm6manKliurC6xLJkqK2kqLalsYyfpqiskpa5rXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lil-tay-social-media-influencer-reportedly-dead-at-14-father-won-t-confirm-wsoc-tv.html>&#171;&nbsp;Lil Tay, social media influencer, reportedly dead at 14; father wont confirm WSOC TV</a>
