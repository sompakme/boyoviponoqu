Evans is also said to be single following his split from Pam & Tommy actress Lily James. The Captain America: Civil War actor, 41, is famously private when it comes to who he’s dating. His relationship with comedian Jenny Slate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which ended in 2018</a>, is the only one Evans has shared publicly.</p><p>A social media sleuth posted on Twitter: "Chris Evans followed Shakira on Instagram the day Shakira and Piqué broke up." The super fan also noted that after Shakira split from Piqué, Evans said in an interview that he was on a mission to find "someone to spend the rest of his life with." In another interview Evans was asked directly what he thought about Shakira's recent split. He responded that he "hadn't had a chance to meet her" but "is a huge fan."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, fans have been excitedly chatting on social media - hoping the two stars make it official. One fan commented: "I just want Shakira and Chris to get together." Another fan added: "The power couple we've all been waiting for." Another third chimed in: "Chris, invite Shakira to dinner, please!" A fourth waded into the debate: "Chris, you know Shakira is free now."</p><h2 id=spanish-media-reports-that-gerard-piqu-eacute-ruined-things-with-shakira>Spanish Media Reports That Gerard Piqué Ruined Things With Shakira</h2><p>Shakira, 45, confirmed that she is no longer in a relationship with her footballer beau, Gerard Piqué, 35, following an 11-year relationship and two children together. The sad statement by the "Waka Waka" singer read: "We regret to confirm that we are parting ways. For the well-being of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect their privacy. Thank you for your understanding." Spanish media <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">El Periodico</a> reports that Shakira kicked Piqué out of their<a href=#> family home</a> after sources claimed he had been unfaithful towards her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Colombian press cites a source that claims Shakira "could no longer cope with the situation" with Piqué.</p><p>"It's something serious and she has been the one who has finally made the decision," they told Spanish website <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Cotilleo</a>. The three-time Grammy winning singer hinted that there was trouble in paradise with her beau in her latest hit "Te Felicito" with Rauw Alejandro. She sings: "To complete you I broke into pieces; I was warned, but I didn't listen; I realized that yours is false...It was the drop that overflowed the glass; Don't tell me you're sorry, that sounds sincere, but I know you well and I know you're lying."</p><p>Shakira first met Piqué in 2011 when he appeared in the music video for her World Cup song "Waka Waka." Piqué's team happened to win the World Cup that year, where Shakira performed during the final game. In the fall of 2012, Shakira would use her Instagram platform to announce to fans that she was pregnant with the football star's son. Two years after the birth of son Milan, the couple revealed they would be expecting their second child, Sasha, who was born in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did Gerard Piqué Turn Down Millions Of Dollars From Shakira Amid Their Breakup?</a></span></p><h2 id=shakira-and-gerard-piqu-eacute-never-became-husband-and-wife>Shakira And Gerard Piqué Never Became Husband And Wife</h2><p>Piqué and Shakira never married, with the "Objection" singer admitting that she was terrified of the idea of marriage and didn't want to stop being desired by Piqué.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez And Shakira's Super Bowl Halftime Show Was Fraught With Unseen Problems</a></span></p><p>"The idea of marriage scares me.
