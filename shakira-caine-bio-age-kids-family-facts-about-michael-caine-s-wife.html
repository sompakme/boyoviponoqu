There are not many details about Caine’s early life or family background. It is however known that her parents were Muslim-Indians and originally hailed from the Kashmir region in India. Shakira Caine spent her formative years in Guyana and completed her education there before going on to work as a secretary. Due to her stunning looks, her boss encouraged her to take part in a national beauty pageant and she heeded the advice.</p><p>Caine emerged 2nd in the Miss Guyana contest and went on to represent her country at the 1967 Miss World pageant in London. At the end of the contest, she decided to stay back in London in order to make a new life for herself. She pursued a modeling career and also got into the movie industry.

Michael Caine (birth name – Maurice Joseph Micklewhite) was born on the 14th of March 1933 in South London. He commenced his career on the stage in the 1950s and got his breakthrough after featuring in the 1963 play, Next Time I’ll Sing to You. His excellent performance in the play earned him a memorable role in the 1964 epic war film, Zulu. Since then, Caine has gone on to feature in over 100 movies including Alfie, The Italian Job, Battle of Britain, Sleuth, The Man Who Would Be King, A Bridge Too Far, Educating Rita, Hannah and Her Sisters, The Cider House Rules, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige, Inception, and Interstellar. He has also received several awards including the 1987 and 2000 Oscar for best supporting actor.</p><p>Shakira Caine first met her future husband in 1971. Legend has it that the actor saw her in a TV commercial and was immediately struck by her beauty. He described her as the most beautiful woman he had ever seen and set about using his contacts to find her. He eventually got her number from a friend in the advertising industry and reached out to her. Caine was not initially enthusiastic about his approach but later warmed to his affections. She accepted to go on a date with him and the rest, as they say, is history. The couple tied the knot in Las Vegas in January 1973 and have been together ever since then. In a 2016 interview on The Jonathan Ross Show, her husband disclosed that the secret to their long union is the fact that they have separate bathrooms.</p><p>Shakira Caine and her husband have one child together; her name is Natasha Haleema Caine and she was born in 1973. There is not much information about Natasha’s professional life. However, she has often landed in the spotlight due to her love life. She has been married twice and divorced twice. Her first marriage was to businessman cum model, Tim Scott, in 2002. Their union did not last long as they divorced that same year. Natasha then got married to a property developer, Michael Hall, in 2007. The marriage produced two sons and a daughter and Natasha filed for divorce in 2013. The divorce was ostensibly caused by her husband’s failure to pay off some embarrassing debts that he owed his business partner. Shakira Caine also has a stepdaughter named Dominique, from her husband’s first marriage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=facts-to-know-about-michael-caines-wife></span><strong>Facts To Know About Michael Caine’s Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>1.
