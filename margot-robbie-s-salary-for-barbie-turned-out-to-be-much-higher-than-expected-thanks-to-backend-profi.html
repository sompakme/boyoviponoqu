Back then, comedian <a href=#>Amy Schumer was set to play Barbie but quit the project</a> after a particular scene didn’t sit well with her. Shortly after, <a href=#>Anne Hathaway was considered for the role of Barbie</a>. Unfortunately, Sony lost the rights to the film in 2018 and the project was then transferred to Warner Bros. That’s when Margot Robbie decided to join the project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Wolf of Wall Street star met with the CEO of Mattel, Ynon Kreiz, to pitch LuckyChap, the production company she co-runs with her friend Josey McNamara and her husband Tom Ackerley, for the project alongside Warner Bros. When they got the green light, Robbie suggested <a href=#>Greta Gerwig</a> direct the film.</p><p>“At the time this was such a terrifying thing to take on. People were like, You’re going to do what?” <a href=#>Robbie told Vogue</a>, explaining that Gerwig only said yes to the project on the condition that she could write the script along with her partner, Noah Baumbach. “It felt sparky to me in some way that felt kind of promising.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/margot-robbie-s-relentless-barbie-promo-outfits-are-insanely-expensive-but-she-likely-didn-t-spend-a-penny-of-her-net-worth-on-them.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Margot Robbie's Relentless Barbie Promo Outfits Are Insanely Expensive But She Likely Didn't Spend A Penny Of Her Net Worth On Them</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>As Margot Robbie toured the world to promote the Barbie movie, she dazzled audiences with a collection of stunning and often costly outfits.</span><p>Despite her involvement in the production of this film, Margot Robbie wasn’t the first choice to play everyone’s favorite doll. In fact, the actress <a href=#>wanted fellow DC star Gal Gadot to play Barbie</a>. “Gal Gadot is Barbie energy. Because Gal Gadot is so impossibly beautiful, but you don’t hate her for being that beautiful, because she’s so genuinely sincere, and she’s so enthusiastically kind, that it’s almost dorky,” Robbie told Vogue for her summer 2023 cover interview.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Wonder Woman star had to turn down the role of Barbie due to other work commitments. Filming for Barbie began in March 2022. At the time, Gadot was so busy filming other movies, including some DC projects, that she just didn’t have time for this project. So, Margot Robbie had to step up for the role. This turned out to be the best outcome, given that Robbie gave one of the best performances of her career.</p><h2 id=producing-and-starring-in-barbie-did-wonders-for-margot-robbie-rsquo-s-net-worth>Producing And Starring In Barbie Did Wonders For Margot Robbie’s Net Worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/barbie-s-cast-and-director-at-the-movie-premiere.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before starring in Barbie, Margot Robbie had a reported net worth of $26 million.
