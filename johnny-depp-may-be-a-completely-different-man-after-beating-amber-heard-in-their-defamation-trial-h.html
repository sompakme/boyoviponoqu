Unlike the libel case in the United Kingdom a couple of years previous, Heard was found liable on all three defamation counts. This was in response to her op-ed published in 2018, which clearly implied that he had done some horrendous things despite not naming Depp. The defamation hurt Depp's reputation in Hollywood, among his peers and fans, and had a financial impact on his career. At least, according to the results of the lawsuit, this is the case.</p><p>According to People, Amber Heard released a statement following her loss that declared that her life as she knew it was "destroyed" by the results. Heard also claimed that she lost all faith in the American legal system which she stated valued "popularity and power" rather than "reason and due process."</p><p>Following this, Heard moved her and her daughter Oonagh Paige to Spain, far away from Depp's fanbase and the leering eyes of the paparazzi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Amber Heard Ever Donate Her Divorce Settlement After Being Exposed In Court For Lying?</a></span></p><p>"Now I finally have an opportunity to emancipate myself from something I <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attempted to leave over six years ago</a> and on terms I can agree to," Amber Heard said in her statement, according to People. "I have made no admission. This is not an act of concession. There are no restrictions or gags with respect to my voice moving forward."</p><p>Of course, all of this and more is examined at length in Netlfix's docuseries, Depp V Heard, which was released on August 16th, 2023.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-amber-heard-owe-johnny-depp-for-defamation><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Does Amber Heard Owe Johnny Depp For Defamation?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/is-johnny-depp-close-to-his-kids-after-his-legal-battle-with-amber-heard_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to People</a>, Amber Heard was ordered to pay $10.35 million in damages to Depp. Depp was also found guilty of defamation on one count (unlike Heard's three), and was ordered to pay her $2 million Both filed for appeals, according to Us Weekly, and reached a settlement in December 2022.</p><p>The final result was Heard would pay Depp $1 million.

"I have various houses in various places and they all mean something special to me. I don't have them just to say I own them, I have them for use and because they are a bit special."</p><p>The main reason he adores his property in Somerset is the privacy.</p><p>"British people are cool and will greet you as if you are a neighbor without going over the top," Depp said to Somerset Life.
