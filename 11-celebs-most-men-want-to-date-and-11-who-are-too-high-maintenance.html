You know, the list of female celebrities they'd give their left arm to date (and likely don't stand a chance). Hollywood may have been designed to give us powerful movies and a boss music industry, but the reality is that it's filled with beautiful women who have most guys head over heels for them. If you're a guy, think of your top five women.</p><p>Are you a Kendall Jenner, Margot Robbie, or Gal Gadot kind of guy? Did you always have a thing for Angelina Jolie or Jennifer Aniston? If you're a girl, you might want to read this. Your guy will inevitably always be rambling on about how cute some actress is, and it's bound to make you a bit jealous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's the thing, though. While some female celebs are as easy-going and laid-back as their carefree Instagram suggests, others are a total, high-maintenance nightmare. For those of you who have J-Lo&nbsp;or Beyonce as your dream woman, you might want to read this before inking her name on your "wish list." That said, for every high-maintenance diva on this list, there's an equal amount of beautiful, down-to-earth girls balancing them out. Got a thing for Penny on The Big Bang Theory? Secretly following Kendall Jenner or Keira Knightley's every move? Are you making sure you're reading this as far away from your girlfriend as possible? If you're a girl, you've got just as much reason to read this. With the high-maintenance demands some of these divas have, you'll be able to whittle down your boyfriend or husband's list by 50%, and we're only just getting started. Here are 11 celebs men want to date (and 11 they might want to reconsider because they're just too high-maintenance).</p><h2 id=gal-gadot-is-a-real-life-wonder-woman><strong>GAL GADOT IS A REAL LIFE WONDER WOMAN</strong></h2><p>Gal Gadot is topping pretty much every list these days. Pulling off Wonder Woman and becoming the highest-grossing star of 2017 is a huge deal, but Gal Gadot's appeal comes from being humble, beautiful, and natural. The Israeli actress has raked in $1.4 billion in movie theater tickets worldwide, and playing Wonder Woman twice in six months is bound to get you noticed. This fierce girl has served in the military, and she was even pregnant while shooting. Every guy in the world is worshipping this real-life superhero, but Gal is no diva. Rolling Stone managed to interview a down-to-earth Gal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Being a woman is a strength. In so many ways," Gal said. "I was a tomboy. Always with wounds and scratches on my knees." Gal's Wonder Woman audition was completely blind. She had no clue what she was even auditioning for. She even filmed Wonder Woman while pregnant.</strong></p><p>Unlike other celebs on this list, Gal has no ridiculous demands. She doesn't flaunt her fame on Instagram, nor does she parade around in extortionately priced designer clothes. Gal is all real. In this pic, Gal proves that you can look flawless with a totally #nomakeup look, and we don't mean that Kylie Jenner style. We hate to ruin it for the guys reading this, but yes, Gal is married. Our next starlet is a complete diva, though...</p><h2 id=beyonce-demands-900-straws-and-hand-carved-ice-balls><strong>BEYONCE DEMANDS $900 STRAWS AND HAND-CARVED ICE BALLS</strong></h2><p>There's no denying that Beyonce is an icon. FYI, with the $104 million she raked in over 2017, according to Forbes, she's also one of the richest women in music. Bey's boss dance moves and power ballads are right up there with her beauty, but this lady comes with a long list of demands. The Daily Mail reported every detail of her reportedly insane tour demands, and it's not painting Beyonce in the best light. While Beyonce has bought $80,000 diamond-encrusted barbies for her daughter, Blue Ivy, this is a singer who takes as much as she gives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyonce insists that her entire crew must wear 100% cotton. Her alkaline water must be chilled to 21 degrees and be served through $900 titanium straws. Hand-carved ice balls must be available after performances for Bey to cool her throat. Blue Ivy's backstage nursery must also have rose-petal candles.</p><p>The Daily Mail's full report continued to list brand-new toilet seats, red toilet paper, and every single dressing room to be fully refurbished before Bey even sets foot in the venue. For a tour that was called "Mrs. Carter Show", this is a diva who is very much saying "it's all about me." Still interested?</p><h2 id=kaley-cuoco-eats-mcdonald-s-before-awards><b>KALEY CUOCO EATS MCDONALD'S BEFORE AWARDS</b></h2><p>No one ever predicted that The Big Bang Theory would ever be this huge. The sitcom that's mostly about the nerdiest guys on the planet hit us with a literal bang, and so did the show's shining star. Blonde, beautiful, and with a twinkle in her eye, Kaley Cuoco was perfect for the role of the street-smart but slightly ditzy, Penny, and boy, is she getting paid. The $1 million per episode paycheck wasn't something TV stars had seen since Friends, but Kaley was here to show every guy on earth that THE GIRL NEXT DOOR IS BACK.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Admit it, you love Kaley Cuoco. It wouldn't be The Big Bang Theory without her witty comebacks, snarky sarcasm, and hilarious triple knocks from Sheldon. Proving she's no diva, here is Kaley chowing down on a cheeseburger just before the Emmy's.</strong></p><p>Kaley posted this pic of her feeding her healthy pre-Emmy appetite with some good old McDonald's, despite wearing full red carpet gear. A real outdoorsy type, Kaley prefers horse-back riding to pretentious poolside selfies. Kaley was even cute enough to play "little Ellen" in Ellen DeGeneres' show, Ellen. We started watching BBT for the LOLs, but admit it, you have a giant crush on Kaley (even if you're a girl).</p><h2 id=ariana-won-t-be-photographed-in-natural-daylight><strong>ARIANA WON'T BE PHOTOGRAPHED IN NATURAL DAYLIGHT</strong></h2><p>The darling of pop suddenly just became a lot less "darling." Ariana Grande has climbed the celeb ranks since her early days on Nickelodeon, but the singer is now as famous for her vocals as she is for her outrageously diva-like demands. "It's like the president is in town," Page Six reported. Ariana's demands are reportedly so extreme, that her own crew is treated "like they don't exist." Ariana's pint-sized pop image sends out "cute bubblegum" vibes, but sources are comparing her to a monster. Even E! interview queen, Giuliana Rancic doesn't know what to make of little miss Grande.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"A toddler throwing a tantrum" is how Page Six spoke of Ariana. "I feel like where there is smoke, there is fire," Giuliana Rancic said about interviewing Ariana. Ariana reportedly refuses to be photographed from the right or in natural daylight.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The report continued, saying that three people must enter a room before Ariana goes anywhere near it. In 2014, NY Daily News even reported that when Ariana gets tired, she "demands to be carried like a baby." The source stated that a tired Ariana won't have her feet touch the floor. During rehearsals for the Victoria's Secret fashion show, Ariana actually demanded to be carried by staff. Is anyone suddenly wanting to switch their Grande for a Tall?</p><h2 id=margot-robbie-is-fun-and-mischievous><strong>MARGOT ROBBIE IS&nbsp;FUN AND MISCHIEVOUS&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Yeah, Margot's on your list. Margot Robbie may have a granny first name, but she's owning her "it girl" status and guys are falling all over the place for her. To be fair, she had a good head start. Starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio will get any starlet noticed, and it definitely delivered when she starred in The Wolf Of Wall Street. Proving she can really act in I, Tonya, Margot isn't just topping crush lists for her looks. The girl can act.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Her roles to date suggest she's a free spirit with boundless confidence and a lip-biting love of mischief," The Telegraph wrote. Just this year, Margot wore stunning white Chanel to the Oscars. No diva demands. No airs and graces. Total girlfriend material.</p><p>The Oscar-nominated actress has a healthy 14.3 million Instagram followers, and an even healthier designer following. Getting the designer in chief of Chanel to hand-tailor your Oscars gown is usually something reserved for the likes of Angelina Jolie or Kate Winslet. At 27 years old, Margot has youth on her side. Every girl is digging her awesome vibes, and every guy is wishing she'd show up at his door in just a pajama t-shirt. Then again, if you prefer the next girl on this list...</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-dictates-her-squad-s-every-move><strong>TAYLOR SWIFT DICTATES HER SQUAD'S EVERY MOVE</strong></h2><p>The easy-going country image disappeared as soon as Taylor Swift realized she had a chance at being mega-rich and mega-famous. The singer is out-selling every other artist around, and she's making sure the world knows her status. Naming your album "Reputation" is dramatic enough, not to mention creating all that pre-release hype by deleting all of your social media in the build-up. Taylor has a solid squad, and it's cherry-picked by Ms. Swift herself. Victoria's Secret supermodels are fine, and if you're Selena Gomez, Lorde or a member of One Direction, that's also acceptable. Here's what isn't.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Taylor is controlling beyond belief, according to TMZ. Taylor forces her friends to do daily workouts, and they can only date following Taylor's approval. “Backstabbing’s a major no-no which is ironic because that’s pretty much all Taylor does herself," a source told the media outlet.</strong></p><p>Taylor also has very specific backstage demands. If TayTay arrives before 11 a.m., she must have&nbsp;one Grande ICED caramel latte with&nbsp;two sweet-n-lows and one Grande ICED Americano with soy milk.&nbsp;She also requires one case of Smartwater, avocados, and specific Ben & Jerry's ice-creams are also on the list. Business Insider was informed that Taylor freaks out if she doesn't have Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and Chocolate Brownie Frozen Yogurt flavors. Eating ice-cream with your regular squad (or girlfriend) not sounding so bad anymore, right?</p><h2 id=britney-is-happy-with-pop-tarts><strong>BRITNEY IS HAPPY WITH POP TARTS</strong></h2><p>Okay, so we all still have a bit of thing for Britney Spears. And why shouldn't we? Britney is proof that you can stick to your roots and still make it in Hollywood, even if you started out from a trailer in a small town. Whether she's dolled-up and looking a million dollars or pulling her stained sweats parking lot look, Britney is still an icon. She's got an enviable body, a cute image, and don't deny it: you totally still sing along to "Hit Me Baby One More Time." The best thing about Britney? She doesn't act like a monster of a diva. The Daily Mail showed us a simple list of Britney's requirements.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Instead of petal-laid towels and $1,000 scented candles, Britney's dressing room demands are Pop Tarts, Doritos, KFC, and Captain Crunch. The most Britney asks for are "fresh towels" and Hellman's mayo for her tuna salad.</strong></p><p>Britney doesn't care if people judge her. She also doesn't care when the press finds her grocery shopping list in a parking lot and it turns out she can't spell. FYI, Britney's grocery list includes "Cinamin" Toast Crunch and "mayennaise". Okay, so she might not be able to spell those, but this mom keeps it real. The other items? Eggs, OJ, and of course her favorite, Captain Crunch.</p><h2 id=j-lo-is-no-jenny-from-the-block><strong>J-LO IS NO JENNY FROM THE BLOCK</strong></h2><p>We literally don't know where to start with Jennifer Lopez. There's no arguing that J-Lo is all kinds of amazing. The most powerful Latina woman in music has $360 million to her name, a prestigious judge position on American Idol, and a very powerful empire. J-Lo is one of the best performers the world has ever seen, but looking at her diva demands, she's no "Jenny From The Block." The Daily Mail has reported that J-Lo's extravagant demands include a specific 80 degrees room temperature (with two humidifiers and oscillating fans), and her candles must be either lime blossom or Jo Malone's grapefruit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>J-Lo's entourage must all wear white and provide her with lime blossom or Jo Malone's grapefruit scented candles. Planter's sunflowers seeds (with shells), green seedless grapes, and two oscillating fans for her 80 degree room are compulsory. She "freaks out" if her M&Ms aren't plain.</strong></p><p>The Daily Mail continued to report that during J-Lo's 2012 tour, eye contact with the star was "forbidden". When she dined out in London, Jenny From The Block couldn't walk the three blocks to lunch at The Dorchester. She reportedly insisted on seven limousines. Talk about keeping it real...</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner-has-every-guy-after-her><strong>KENDALL JENNER HAS EVERY GUY AFTER HER</strong></h2><p>What's not to love? If you thought Kendall Jenner only had Kardashian-Jenner girls following her Instagram, think again. She's got the face of an angel, the family's trademark curves, and a hipster vibe that's edgy, unique, and totally on-trend. Is there another supermodel out there posing in vintage Corvettes outside In-N-Out Burger? To be fair, if you're a guy, there's a lot to gawk at. Kendall is blown-up on NYC Times Square billboards in Calvin Kelin underwear, posting racy lingerie shots for La Perla, plus, she's the face of Adidas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Kendall Jenner is so "it girl," it hurts. Her freckled selfies are adorable, and her curves are landing her lingerie contracts like there's no tomorrow. Kendall is a model who eats a lot. Where did she head right after the 2016 Victoria's Secret fashion show? Straight to a burger joint.</strong></p><p>Kendall is definitely the most unique member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. She's got a super-appealing edge— whether she's looking cute as a button with ponies, or putting herself behind the camera instead of in front of it. Kendall was the highest-paid model of 2017, according to Forbes, with an $18 million paycheck. If you're lucky enough to get Kendall as your date, she'll probably zoom you straight to In-N-Out. (But she'll probably pay) Guys are literally counting down the days until Kenny makes Blake Griffin history.</p><h2 id=mariah-carey-is-the-biggest-diva-on-earth><strong>MARIAH CAREY IS THE BIGGEST DIVA ON EARTH</strong></h2><p>There are literally no words for Mariah Carey. Powerful vocals and an unbeatable whistle register are what Mariah has to thank for her staggering $535 million net worth, but even her billionaire fiancée couldn't handler her diva demands. From $2,000 thrones and penthouse suites just for her Louis Vuitton luggage, Mariah's entourage is her ego. Her billionaire fiancée, James Packer, reportedly dumped her for her "extortionate spending," although, burning her $250,000 custom-made Valentino wedding gown in a fire pit was hardly proving him wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I don't think I'm demanding enough," Mariah said in 2008. $100,000 a month on exotic flowers, $19,000 on looking good for a single appearance, and no less than 20 humidifiers? Mariah won't sign autographs unless her antique table is covered in silk cloth.</strong></p><p>Mariah's high-maintenance ways are the most-feared in the industry. If you want to talk to Mariah, you'll have to do it before the 48-hour "no talking" pre-performance period, and if you're her assistant, you better get the dressing room demands right. That's 12 one-liter bottles of Fiji water, draped black rooms that cannot open into dressing rooms, and $2,000 thrones that must be surrounded by roses and butterflies. We'd ask if you still want to get near Mariah, but that would involve getting past her 11 bodyguards...</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-is-still-america-s-sweetheart><strong>JENNIFER ANISTON IS STILL AMERICA'S SWEETHEART</strong></h2><p>It's hard not to be in love with Jennifer Aniston. The original American sweetheart won us over from day one on Friends, and her girl-next-door charm is still going strong decades later. Jen may be one of the most heart-broken girls in Hollywood, but she's still one of the most beautiful. Following her divorce from Brad Pitt (and the arrival of a certain Angelina Jolie), Jen now walks the Hollywood boulevards with a #TeamJen army behind her. No-one cares that Jen is 49. She doesn't look a day over 39.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When it comes to being America's sweetheart, Jen blows the other A-Listers out the water. Jen may have lost Brad, but every other guy on the planet is still waiting in line for a chance with Rachel from Friends.</strong></p><p>Jen made headlines this year, as she announced her split from second husband, Justin Theroux. Despite a staggering $200 million to her name, you won't find a single ridiculous demand when it comes to Jen. Jennifer is the face of Smartwater. You'll see her out and about bottle-in-hand, but aside from some purifying water, this girl is natural, carefree, and super easy-going. Jen has appeared on The Ellen Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live with the same funny and humble charm that won us over in the first place. A golden girl with a heart of gold.</p><h2 id=katy-perry-is-no-teenage-dream><strong>KATY PERRY IS NO TEENAGE DREAM</strong></h2><p>Katy Perry may be super-attractive, but this singer is also super demanding. If you're hell-bent on getting near Katy, maybe you'd like the job of being her vegetable "cleaner and cutter?" Katy may have started out with tracks like "Teenage Dream," but once the cash started rolling in, she very much became a "California Girl." The Huffington Post dug deep to find this singer's diva demands, and boy is the list long. First, there are the rules. "Staff mustn't speak to her," the newspaper reported. That said, they do have to provide Katy with: specially made French lamps, rugs that must be cream or pink, and when she stays in hotels, she "trashes the rooms."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Katy Perry requires pink and white roses, peonies, and hydrangeas flowers. Carnations are not allowed. Katy will trash hotel rooms, but her must-haves are strict—personally cut vegetables,&nbsp;six Vitamin waters zero, organic grapes, and tortilla chips that must be blue corn. "We've been told we can't speak to her," staff said.</p><p>Katy's edgy-yet-bubblegum image and eye-popping outfits have a lot of guys ogling over her. Katy may share Instagram posts of herself with a McDonald's chicken sandwich, but she'll fire her vegetable cutter if they get her cucumber sticks wrong. Sorry, did you want to date this girl?</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-throws-taco-parties>&nbsp;<strong>SELENA GOMEZ THROWS TACO PARTIES</strong></h2><p>Finally, a high-profile celeb who isn't a ridiculous diva. Selena Gomez may hang with Taylor Swift and have Justin Bieber as her ex-boyfriend, but she stands out from the crowd for her easy-going vibe and chilled personality. Her friends know to expect an actually fun time with Selena— not surprising then, that they threw her a taco cake birthday party. Compare that to Kylie Jenner, who was reportedly paid $100,000 to turn up to her own birthday party. The Daily Mail reported that Kylie arrived at her bash by helicopter, but stayed less than one hour. Meanwhile, you've got Selena, whose favorite food is pizza (except when she's enjoying a taco birthday cake).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I don't need a lot of things," Selena told Billboard. Selena gave the interview makeup-free after a hot Pilates class.</strong></p><p>Selena has experienced real problems. After undergoing a kidney transplant, she raised $500,000 to help find a cure for the Lupus disease. Her friend, Petra Collins said, "Selena cares so deeply for things." When you're a glittering star with over 135 million Instagram followers, it's easy to fall into the temptation of becoming a diva. Selena sits at a firm "no" when it comes to outrageous demands, and we love her even more for it. Plus, she's just gorgeous.</p><h2 id=christina-employs-someone-to-massage-her-feet><strong>CHRISTINA EMPLOYS SOMEONE TO MASSAGE HER FEET</strong></h2><p>Oh, look. Another singer with a giant attitude and ridiculous demands that belittle her staff. Christina Aguilera can't be faulted on her flawless vocals, but her diva reputation is out there, and it's not pretty. The Sun reported that The Voice judge and singer only travels by police escort, and that's before we get to her hotel room demands. Presumably, because Christina wants everything like her "Beautiful" track, that's two eight-feet tables with cloths, plants, and flowers, and some very specific food and beverage requests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Water, but NOT Evian," The Sun reported as Xtina's first demand. "Under no circumstances are Christina's police escort vehicles allowed to encounter any delays due to traffic." Is that even possible? Flintstone's vitamins and a "guy to massage her feet" are also on the list.</p><p>"She has a guy on staff whose job it is to massage her feet at 30-minute intervals," Star Magazine reported. Despite earning $18 million per cycle on The Voice, Xtina is said to show up "two hours late." Still, she insists that deserves the special treatment she demands. Christina's staff are reportedly sick and tired of the diva behaving like a "spoiled brat," but hey, if you want to get near this star, it comes with its rules.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis-arrived-in-the-us-with-just-250><strong>MILA KUNIS ARRIVED IN THE US WITH JUST $250</strong></h2><p>That face. Mila Kunis is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Considering her first acting job was a Barbie commercial, the actress has come a long way. Mila wins when it comes to humble beginnings. Her family moved to the US from Ukraine with just $250 to their name, and Mila knows what it's like to be dirt poor. Speaking to Vanity Fair about raising Hollywood kids that don't live in a total California bubble, Mila said: "It's so important because we both came from pretty, pretty, solid poverty backgrounds and few up very poor."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mila is happy to know that her kids will "never have to know what it's like to have ketchup soup for dinner." Down-to-earth, absolutely beautiful, and totally real, Mila has said she is "very aware of what a dollar is worth."</p><p>Mila continually tops lists as the world's most beautiful woman. She's also incredibly unique, with one blue eye and one green eye. The Black Swan actress even used to work as a bartender for free, and her ideal chill time is playing World of Warcraft. Oh, come on. A beautiful girl who's happy to hang at home and play video games? Mila is too good to be true.</p><h2 id=kim-k-is-messy-and-takes-6-000-selfies-a-day><strong>KIM K IS&nbsp;MESSY AND TAKES 6,000 SELFIES A DAY</strong></h2><p>Kim Kardashian is the most talked-about woman on the internet. That's generally going to happen when you pose with no clothes on the cover of Paper magazine, with the caption: "Break the internet." Kim K is one of the smartest and most-powerful women in showbiz. $53 million is what she casually tweeted she was "transferring" into her and husband, Kanye West's joint account in 2016, and that was just the earnings from her video game: Kim Kardashian Hollywood. Her former assistant, Stephanie Shepherd, opened up about what really goes on being Kardashian doors though, and it's no picnic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She is so vain that she has staff remove plants or objects if they're in the way of a mirror," Kim's former assistant said. During Kim's Punta Mita vacation in Mexico, Kim took 6,000 selfies over four days. The Daily Star reported "overflowing trash in the kitchen," and that Kim's glossed image is just a front for her being a "giant slob."</p><p>Kim posts pics of trash cans with Louis Vuitton logos. She also makes sure she's papped with her brood looking like a wholesome and family dedicated mom. While there's no debating that Kim adores her three kids, The Mirror reported that the "well-oiled machine has nannies bringing the kids in for a quick Snapchat, then whipping them away if they start to cry." Kim may be very desirable physically, but this Kardashian is one high-maintenance diva.</p><h2 id=keira-knightley-is-surprisingly-low-maintenance><strong>KEIRA KNIGHTLEY IS SURPRISINGLY LOW-MAINTENANCE</strong></h2><p>You'd think a British actress with roles like Pirates of the Caribbean would be high-maintenance. Keira Knightley exploded onto the Hollywood scene with her model-like physique, heart-warming smile, and beautiful face. Guys consistently rank Keira as one of their "dream girls," and unlike other high-earning actresses, Keira is surprisingly low-maintenance. According to Glamour, Keira can be ready for a night out in under five minutes, although, English Rose's natural beauty helps as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keira admitted that she doesn't know why she has a low Uber rating. "I think it's because I don't chat," she says. We're okay with that. During her Harper's Bazaar interview, Keira ate a croissant and wore denim with a simple leather jacket. She didn't even have a publicist with her.</p><p>Keira might be riding a motorcycle across glamorous Parisian streets for her Chanel fragrance ad, but this is an actress who is super-approachable. "Yesterday I had two really lovely people come up to me in the street and just say how much they like my work," Keira told the magazine. Strictly no makeup is her go-to style, and she's admitted she was a "tomboy." Let's see, a beautiful, British, low-maintenance actress with a model body and a smile that makes you weak at the knees? Yeah, Keira is a girl guys want to date.</p><h2 id=rihanna-throws-fits-if-she-doesn-t-get-her-way><strong>RIHANNA THROWS FITS IF SHE DOESN'T GET HER WAY</strong></h2><p>When your Instagram handle is @badgirlriri, that's a bit of a red flag. Rihanna may duo with the likes of Eminem, but you don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out who's the diva here. The Mirror got ahold of the 10-page document that stipulates this singer's every request, and it's reported that RiRi "throws fits" should the slightest item be less-than-perfect. RiRi's rooms must have animal-print throw rugs, and all brick surfaces must be covered with white drapes and that's before we get to her dressing room items.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rihanna has a 10-page document outlining her demands. White-upholstered furnishings and drapes cannot show any exposed brick. Her private chef is also on-hand for precisely 12 flying-fish fillets and garlic-stuffed green olives for her 73-degree, animal print room. 4 small, square vases must have White Casablanca lilies for her Archipelago Black Forest candles. Just, dude.</p><p>The only vaguely relatable request RiRi has are Cheetos Crunchy Flamin' Hot snacks. The Mirror also reported that during her Sweden tour, Rihanna sent staff out "in the middle of nowhere" to find her specified items. Those White Casablanca lilies we mentioned earlier? Sorry, we meant White Casablanca lilies with NO FOLIAGE. Just one more music diva who's lost us with her unrealistic and high-maintenance demands.</p><h2 id=kate-upton-enjoys-baseball-with-sushi><strong>KATE UPTON ENJOYS BASEBALL WITH SUSHI</strong></h2><p>Kate Upton is a blonde you can finally get on board with. The Sports Illustrated model and actress has sun-kissed locks and seriously good bone structure as her trademark, but Kate would make one chilled girlfriend. Kate doesn't parade around like some diva, and you only need to look at her Instagram to know that this girl works out. The Michigan-born model might attend premieres with Nicki Minaj or post boss sports pics with Chrissy Teigen, but she's surprisingly laid-back. Kate's "body confidence" interview with Vogue in 2017 "thanked the haters," although we're not sure what's to hate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After my first cover, critics were discussing whether I was fat or not," Kate told Vogue, "I had this huge moment in my career and they were tearing it apart." Kate's favorite thing to do is snack on sushi while watching the New York Yankees.</p><p>You'll see Kate court-side on her Instagram, but this model isn't just gracing the cover of Vanity Fair. Her acting career is going places, with roles in The Layover and Tower Heist, and gamers will love the next part. In 2014, Kate was the centerpiece of a $40 million ad campaign for Machine Zone's mobile app: Game of War: Fire Age. Yeah, we live in an age of fire. Kate Upton just lit it up.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-needs-smoothie-stations><strong>LADY GAGA NEEDS SMOOTHIE STATIONS</strong></h2><p>Better break out the blenders if Lady Gaga is in town. The singer might be original with her unconventional persona and record-breaking albums, but when you name your album,&nbsp;The Fame,&nbsp;it's pretty obvious you're a bit of a diva. Business Insider got their hands on Lady Gaga's list of demands, and they say two things: Hard Work. Lady Gaga is definitely an icon. There's an attractive girl under the layers of makeup and statement costumes, but there's also a very high-profile list of requests. It starts with the smoothie station Lady Gaga must have in her dressing room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lady Gaga must have a smoothie station with fuze and whey protein, frozen berries, and non-fat Greek yogurt. Her fruits must have edible skin or seeds. Add on the cool-mist humidifier,&nbsp;four unscented candles, and hot dogs that MUST be served with toothpicks, Lady Gaga is a handful.</p><p>"I'm not free anymore," Lady Gaga told Rolling Stone. Apparently, she misses just "going out into the world and meeting people." Newsflash. You can be a celebrity and still be approachable. Selena Gomez is managing it just fine, and hanging out with her might even get you tacos. Lady Gaga may want to tone down the demands, although her answer would probably be that she was "Born This Way." Please. Enough of the divas.</p><h2 id=gigi-hadid-eats-burgers-all-the-time><strong>GIGI HADID EATS BURGERS&nbsp;ALL THE TIME</strong></h2><p>There's no arguing this one. Guys love models. When they're "it girls," Victoria's Secret Angels, and totally owning their gorgeous looks, it's hard not to have someone like Gigi Hadid on your list. The model is rubbing shoulders with her sister, Bella, Kendall Jenner, and every other supermodel in town. To top it off, this is a model who loves her burgers. Gigi has appeared on The Tonight Show burger-in-hand, and chowing down on a cheeseburger was the first thing she did after the 2016 Victoria's Secret show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"@jimmy fallon I have a "Best Burger in NY" update, talk soon," Gigi tweeted in April 2018. Gigi says that "burgers keep me sane", and she ranks NYC burger joint, J.G.Melon as her favorite spot. A stunning model who'll share fries? Yeah, Gigi is a no-brainer.</p><p>"If I tell people I'm boxing and then I'm eating a cheeseburger tonight, it's because I am," Gigi told Harper's Bazaar. "I'm not cheating and eating a salad and then being like: Yeah, burgers are cool!" Pressure to live off salads is insane in the modeling world. Proving that you can rock a supermodel body and still have a beef patty in a bun, Gigi really puts her money where her mouth is.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner-makes-ellen-cater-to-her-requests><strong>KYLIE JENNER MAKES ELLEN CATER TO HER REQUESTS</strong></h2><p>Are you getting a bit tired of Kylie Jenner? The youngest Kardashian may on her way to becoming the richest member of the clan, but she's alienating her fans one ludicrous luxury at a time. If Kylie isn't dropping $1.4 million on Ferraris, following the surprise announcement of her baby girl, Stormi Webster, she's making diva demands— even to Ellen DeGeneres. Bravo reported that Kylie's former assistants shared the deets on Kylie, and they are very specific indeed. When it came to appearing on The Ellen Show, Kylie reportedly insisted on two VIP parking spots, because she "did not want to walk from the parking lot to the studio- less than a block away."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kylie must have her drinks at a certain temperature, and if you touch her straw, "there will be hell to pay," according to Bravo. If Kylie's assistants get her smoothies wrong, she replies: "You should know the flavor." If the smoothie are the wrong temperature, Kylie just says: "forget it."</p><p>This is a girl who literally has no concept of the real world. She's posted selfies in purse closets worth $400,000 and spent the exact same amount on a Lamborghini Aventador. On her Life of Kylie show, she felt sad "because we never take the Lambo out."</p><p>If you're a guy, you might seriously want to reconsider some of these celebs. On the other hand, if Gal Gadot or Mila Kunis are on your "wish list," you should hit share for your buddies. If you're a girl and have ever heard your boyfriend mention these girls, get the message out there. Some of these ladies are way too high-maintenance to ever bother with. Leave us a comment on who you'd totally date (and who you would never go near in a million years).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpYWKwprjEm6pmpZ%2BowW65xKdksJmeqXq1u4ydmK2dXZa7pXmQamSwoJ9irrOxjK2mqGWYnrSpecyaoKeslaOur6%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./case-keenum-net-worth-how-much-is-keenum-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Case Keenum Net Worth How Much is Keenum Worth?</a>
