After Portwood became pregnant at 18, the two were featured on the MTV docu-series that chronicled the lives and struggles of young parents. Shirley <strong>famously proposed to Portwood with a ring he purchased at Wal-Mart,</strong> but the two ultimately called off their engagement. Due to Portwood’s substance abuse and legal issues, Shirley was granted full custody of Leah in 2011. Since then, Shirley went on to marry Kristina Shirley and have another daughter, Emilee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Portwood and Shirley have gone through their ups and downs as co-parents, but Shirley always made an effort to keep Portwood in Leah’s life.

Leah has seemingly lived a stable life with her father and stepfather.
