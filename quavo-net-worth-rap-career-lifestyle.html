Quavo’s net worth is approximately $26 million as of December 2022.</span></p><p><span>His major source of income is from record album sales and band gigs. He does, however, have some additional sources of money.</span></p><p><span>Let’s take a peek at how Quavo makes his millions.</span></p><h4><span>Earnings From Albums Sales and Tours</span></h4><p><span>Quavo’s record sales as a member of Migos and a solo artist have netted him millions of dollars.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>300 Entertainment and Quality Control Music previously managed Migos. The band, however, left 300 Entertainment in 2015.</span></p><p><span>Under 300 Entertainment, the band only made <strong>$30,000-$40,000</strong> each performance, while with Quality Control Music, they garnered up to <strong>$60,000.</strong></span></p><p><span>Migos earned <strong>$150,000</strong> for each show on their <strong>2016 tour.</strong></span></p><p><span>Likewise, their <strong>93-show tour</strong> earned them a stunning <strong>$25 million</strong> between 2017 and 2018, with Quavo receiving one-third of the proceeds.</span></p><p><span>Migos is a highest-selling trio in the music business, with <strong>4 billion online streams</strong> as one of the most prominent streaming groups on internet platforms.</span></p><h4><span>Earning From Brand Endorsements and Collaborations</span></h4><p><span>As a member of Migos, Quavo is associated with numerous businesses, including Beats By Dr. Dre, Mountain Dew, Avianne Jewelers, and Finish Line.</span></p><p><span>Quavo, as a solo artist, has begun to accept personal brand sponsorships in recent years.</span></p><p><span>When his friend and rapper Meek Mill became a co-owner of the retail athletic firm Lids in 2019, Quavo became the company’s brand ambassador.</span></p><p><span>Lids is North America’s largest retailer of headgear and licensed sports merchandise.</span></p><p><span>The rapper also partnered to launch a limited-edition hat collection, which netted him additional money.</span></p><p><span>From gaining recognition and boosting his net worth through music to being the face of retail goods and earning a second income, </span><span>Quavo has created a name for himself as a great artist and savvy brand advocate.</span></p><p><span>In December 2021, the rapper was last seen as a featured artist on Bobby Shmurda’s tune Shmoney.</span></p><h2 id=net-worth-of-offset-in-different-currencies><span
