They were married from 1972 to 1981, and welcomed a son and a daughter, Burt (born 1976) and Cassandra (born in 1980). Burt and Cassandra made a few appearances on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in its early seasons, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were absent from the show once it surged in popularity.</a></p><p>A few years later, Burt admitted to not only wanting to not be involved with KUWTK, but to not even watching it. "I don't watch it. It's just not part of my life," Burt has previously commented.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Robert Pattinson And Kristen Stewart Still Talk?</a></span></p><p>Caitlyn went on to re-marry Linda Thompson in 1981.

But by the show was in its final seasons, Brandon and Brody were absent from the show.

Especially for his Caitlyn’s eldest two kids, it may have been weird being asked to be a part of KUWTK, since Caitlyn hadn’t been a big part of their childhood up until then.</p><p>In 2015, Burt admitted that <a href=#>Caitlyn had never financially supported him</a>, despite his father being worth millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My dad's never helped me out [financially] in my life," he told Esquire . "I made it this far […] Nobody's going to call me a daddy's kid."</p><p>Brandon and Brody have made similar claims. In his book To Me, He Was Just Dad, Brandon revealed how his relationship with Caitlyn changed once she married Kris Jenner.</p><p>"I didn't see my father more than half a dozen times between the ages 8 and 25," Brandon wrote. “After Dad met and married Kris, family became a business for him, and I stayed away for most of my teenage years. I didn't want to be a part of their dynamic."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Eminem’s Daughter Hailie Is Engaged, But Did Eminem Release Any Type Of Statement?</a></span></p><p>Caitlyn hasn’t denied her children’s claims.

I am the well-meaning but confused and helpless father and husband. I get love but very little respect. I'm fine with that, because it is largely accurate."</p><p>Luckily, Caitlyn’s older children have revealed their relationship is getting better – something that appears to have started when Cait came out as transgender and distanced herself from the Kardashian family.</p><p>"My relationship with Caitlyn is much better,” Cassandra told PEOPLE. “But we still have a lot of work to do.
