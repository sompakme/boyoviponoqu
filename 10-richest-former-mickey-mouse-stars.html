The stars of the show would break into song and dance, and participate in sketch comedy. Most of the skits played off of popular movies, musicals, and often attempted to earnestly educate teens on how to handle real-life situations, in that after-school-special way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the biggest mega stars in TV, music and film today got their start as a young “mouseketeer” on the show - the following are currently the 10 richest of these one-time child stars in the entertainment industry today.</p><h2 id=10-nikki-deloach---1-million><b>10: Nikki Deloach - $1 Million</b></h2><p>Actress Nikki Deloach, best known for her roles in the film <i>Love & Other Drugs </i>and the TV show <i>Awkward</i>, was a “mouseketeer” in her early days.
