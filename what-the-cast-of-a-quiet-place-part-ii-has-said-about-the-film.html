Are the cast members happy about the movie's outcome? What have they been saying about it? To sum it up, here's everything A Quiet Place: Part II cast members and important producers have been saying about the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thriller</a>.</p><h2 id=scott-beck><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Scott Beck</span></h2><p>While Scott Beck is not a cast member at all, he's undoubtedly the most important person in creating the Quiet Place franchise. Back in the '90s when he and longtime friend Bryan Woods were students at the University of Iowa, the two boyhood friends crafted the earliest forms of the script before becoming what we've seen today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Bryan and I, we've known each other since we were 11-years-old and even at that point in our life, we were always writing short stories or plays, and things that we could do with our friends," said the screenwriter in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>.</p><h2 id=bryan-woods><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bryan Woods</span></h2><p>His longtime friend, Bryan Woods, gave the stamp of approval and reminisced the time when they crafted a scrappy B horror film called The Sleepover. It centers around a group of kids having a sleepover party before aliens come and take over.</p><p>"We would take all these classes together, and we had this one verbal communication class that we really responded to. It was all about how much we all say to each other without speaking, how much we say with gestures or facial expressions," he recalled about the inspiration behind the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'A Quiet Place': 20 Movie Facts Many Viewers Haven't "Heard" Of</a></span></p><h2 id=scoot-mcnairy><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Scoot McNairy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Scoot-McNairy.jpg><p>Another shocking addition to the star-studded cast members is Scoot McNairy, who portrays Agent Walt Breslin in over 20 episodes of Narcos: Mexico since 2018. In A Quiet Place, he plays the leader of a dangerous group that preys on travelers.</p><p>"I think my attitude more so is, 'Let’s take this other thing right here that’s not that good and let’s try and make it good. Let’s do it, let’s get to work on it and get creative and try and make this show or project good,'" he said about his creative trajectory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-krasinski><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>John Krasinski</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/John-Krasinski.jpg><p>Besides portraying Lee, the main hero's deceased husband, John Krasinski was pretty busy in the director seat. However, when the sequel idea came up after the first movie premiered in 2018, he was one of the few people who disapproved of it, because he thought it would only be a desperate attempt of cash-grabbing.</p><p>"When I see sequels, a lot of times I do the eye roll, like, 'Man, it's just a cash grab studio kind of move, and it's not going to be nearly as good as the first.' And<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> I didn't want that to happen, so I just said no</a>," he said, as reported by ScreenRant.</p><h2 id=djimon-hounsou><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Djimon Hounsou</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Captain Marvel star Djimon Hounsou is also in this movie. Interestingly, he joined the cast members a little later to replace Brian Tyree Henry, who left the project due to scheduling problems.</p><p>"One thing that surprised me by him [John Krasinski] is his directions are mostly emotionally driven direction," he spoke highly about the director. "He won't give you a line reading. As much as it may sound I like a line reading, it's more about your emotional reading."</p><h2 id=noah-jupe><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Noah Jupe</span></h2><p>Noah Jupe reprised his role as Marcus, Evelyn's son, on the screen. Off the screen, the actor said that he would trust his life to Emily Blunt, his on-screen mother, should a zombie apocalypse happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If there's ever a zombie apocalypse or anything, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm just gonna call up Emily </a>and be like: 'Yo, can I come and stay over at yours for a bit?' She'd know what to do," he told Independent.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden In Plain Sight: 18 "Unheard" Meanings In 'A Quiet Place'</a></span></p><h2 id=millicent-simmonds><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Millicent Simmonds</span></h2><p>Millicent Simmonds shot to stardom for portraying Evelyn's deaf daughter, Regan, in the Quiet Place franchise. However, she later admitted that portraying such a complex character in such a high-intensity surrounding was quite stressful, both physically and mentally.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This was very dynamic, physical, and a lot more stressful </a>- both on a physical and emotional level compared to the first one. That was the main difference," she told ScreenRant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cillian-murphy><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Cillian Murphy</span></h2><p>Surprisingly, Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy is also in this movie as Emmet, a cold-heartened survivor and an old friend of the deceased husband.</p><p>"Well, for me, he's just a natural director. You cannot learn that; you just have it. And the first movie was a testament to that; to know how to create that suspense, to know how to create that drama," he spoke highly about the director.</p><h2 id=emily-blunt><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Emily Blunt</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">However, for Emily Blunt, she admitted that there are some blurry lines between herself and the character she plays in this movie. She even confessed that some scenes left her speechless&nbsp;because it really resonates with her as a mother of two daughters.</p><p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">"It’s her, standing in front of her children, and protecting them at all costs," the actress said. "The bright line between myself and the character, which I normally have on most sets, got fairly blurry for me. And some scenes absolutely left me on the floor."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 15 Things You Didn't Know About The Making Of A Quiet Place</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGpsYycmKysXaSzbq2MqqyinaRiva2twp5kqZmiqXqqtYyhmKxlo5a2pXnAm6aurF2ptaZ5xaKjpmc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./5-nfl-players-who-own-owned-wineries.html>&#171;&nbsp;5 NFL Players Who Own/Owned Wineries</a>
