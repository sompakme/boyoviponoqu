This month, it seems like we're witnessing a brand-new friendship emerging: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Emily Blunt</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two have been busy promoting their latest adventure film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jungle Cruise</a>, and their chemistry is unmatched, both on and off the screen. The film itself has been quite a massive hit, especially during the ongoing health crisis where theaters and cinemas openings are heavily impacted.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Ellen DeGeneres Has Done Since Getting Canceled</a></span></p><p>So, how did they start working together? How was the creative process behind the blockbuster film? Is it true that Emily possesses something that other Dwayne's co-stars couldn't get their hands on? Here's the truth behind <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a> and Emily Blunt's wholesome friendship.</p><h2 id=he-admired-emily-blunt-since-the-devil-wears-prada><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Admired Emily Blunt Since 'The Devil Wears Prada'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the recent edition of The Hollywood Reporter issue, Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt sat down with THR's Rebecca Keegan to discuss how the chemistry started. According to the actor, he's been a fan of Emily Blunt since he saw her on The Devil Wears Prada in 2006.</p><p>"He said to me once, 'I love that your debut was onstage with Dame Judi Dench and mine was in the wrestling ring cutting myself with razors,'" Blunt said, comparing between her debut and Dwayne's WWE background.</p><h2 id=due-to-her-busy-schedule-emily-almost-declined-jungle-cruise><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Due To Her Busy Schedule, Emily Almost Declined 'Jungle Cruise'</span></h2><p>However, it turns out that Emily Blunt was very close to declining the offer to star in the film. Over the past few years, she's been busy shooting Mary Poppins Returns and A Quiet Place, back-to-back. Interestingly, the latter's sequel, A Quiet Place 2, was also released not too long ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had always admired her as an actor, but also when I would watch her on talk shows, she had this personality that was effervescent, that was cool and very, very charming," Dwayne spoke highly about his co-star.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-recorded-a-video-to-convince-her-to-join-the-film-but-she-ghosted-him><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Dwayne Johnson Recorded A Video To Convince Her To Join The Film, But She Ghosted Him</span></h2><p>To convince Emily to accept the role, the film's director Jaume Collet-Serra had to fly all the way to her Brooklyn home to hand the script in person. Then, Dwayne recorded a video as a message for her to convince her to join the cast.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How These Famous Couples Make Long Distance Work</a></span></p><p>"I had not even met her. And I wanted to let her know via this video just how important she was to this movie and how I only wanted her in this movie," Johnson recalled. "And I … I actually never heard again from Emily. Didn’t respond at all. Just ghosted me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-film-itself-has-been-a-massive-success><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Film Itself Has Been A Massive Success</span></h2><p>It's rare to see a movie doing so well in the theaters amidst the pandemic, but Jungle Cruise was something else. The film was released theatrically and through Disney+ with Premier Access. Although it received somewhat mixed receptions from the critics, Jungle Cruise has grossed over $66 million worldwide through cinemas and $30 more through Disney in its opening weekend. All that, thanks to Dwayne and Emily's unmatched chemistry!</p><h2 id=it-s-been-a-busy-week-for-emily-blunt><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>It's Been A Busy Week For Emily Blunt</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, it's been a hectic few weeks for Emily Blunt. Before Jungle Cruise, she was also busy promoting A Quiet Place 2. Meanwhile, Dwayne has been somewhat divided, as Fast & Furious 9 hit the screen without him due to his long-time feud with fellow co-star Vin Diesel.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Have This Complaint About Dwayne Johnson’s Career</a></span></p><h2 id=dwayne-entrusted-her-with-his-45-000-pound-traveling-gym><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dwayne Entrusted Her With His 45,000-Pound Traveling Gym</span></h2><p>It's no secret that Dwayne Johnson is a gym freak. In fact, he has a team of people with a few 18-wheelers to fit his "portable" 45,000-pound gym machines and accessories to accompany him everywhere on a film set. Not every one of Dwayne's co-star can get their hands on this precious possession, except if you're Emily Blunt and her husband, John Krasinski.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So, he has this gym called the Iron Paradise," explained Blunt during an interview with Jonathan Ross. "And I didn’t realize that no one had ever been allowed in the Iron Paradise. It’s his inner sanctum."</p><h2 id=the-original-2011-version-of-the-film-had-tom-hanks-amp-tim-allen-as-the-stars><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Original 2011 Version Of The Film Had Tom Hanks & Tim Allen As The Stars</span></h2><p>Interestingly, the original script of Jungle Cruise didn't even involve Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt. The production started all the way back in 2011 with actors Tom Hanks or Tim Allen in mind. However, that version fell through, leaving a spot for Dwayne to fill in August 2015 before Emily joined the star-studded cast in spring 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-has-been-some-discussions-about-a-possible-sequel><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>There Has Been Some Discussions About A Possible Sequel</span></h2><p>Not too long after Jungle Cruise hit the cinema, Dwayne Johnson revealed that there are talks happening for a possible sequel. The end of the film sets a cliffhanger for potential follow-ups, so here's hoping for more Dr. Lily and Frank moments!</p><p>"Thank you buddy!
