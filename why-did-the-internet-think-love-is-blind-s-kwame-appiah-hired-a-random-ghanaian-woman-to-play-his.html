"All of this content was taken during our engagement, when the big cameras weren't on us," he wrote in the caption.</p><p>"We got to enjoy life, and communicate, in the ways that feel most natural to us," he continued.

And in Mexico, there was tequila flowing, there was a lot happening, and you have cameras all around you. It's an elevated, intense experience."</p><p>Speaking about that tensed pool party, Chelsea said that she saw everything, but "it wasn’t in my nature to interject in their conversation." She also acknowledged that there was "some closure that needed to happen," despite it being "uncomfortable [to watch] at times."</p><p>"I respect Kwame's journey, and I don’t have any bad blood towards Micah," she continued. "The way I see it, if someone else is so into my man, then she's probably cool. She's probably awesome like me. I do feel that. And there's no bad blood there.

She really saw my character and who I was."</p><p>She also said that she gets why Kwame's mother didn't approve of their marriage at first. "This was a very non-traditional, fast experience where he had to follow his own heart.

"Unfortunately false," one tweeted of the rumors. "I just went down a rabbit hole locating family photos — but would love this if it were true."
