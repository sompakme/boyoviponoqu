They wrote, "Watching the reunion made me more confident in my theory that the whole Hannah drama was staged by production."</p><p>The fan continued that Hannah explained that she didn't want to work in the industry anymore and that she "didn't regret the season" as she made some good money. The fan thinks that Hannah wasn't interested in appearing on the show anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This fan explained more about their theory: "production offered a big contract with the stipulation of the Valium storyline allowing her an early out. Malia said at the reunion she saw the Valium the night of Hannah’s panic attack but didn’t report until later (production wasn’t ready for it yet). She also said she went to production before Sandy which seems shady."</p><p>Many people responded saying that this theory makes sense. One said that there are tons of storylines in the reality TV genre that are "staged" so they would understand if this one was, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Below Deck Franchise Just Keeps Getting Darker</a></span></p><h2 id=the-below-deck-storyline>The 'Below Deck' Storyline</h2><p>Let's take a closer look at the storyline on&nbsp;Below Deck&nbsp;that people are referring to.</p><p>According to&nbsp;People,&nbsp;Malia White told Capitan Sandy Yawn that Hannah had a CBD pen and&nbsp;Valium in her cabin on the boat.

That’s when it became a real serious thing for me.” She continued, "I already had my bunk at that point, so, yeah, it was because it was my duty to.

She said that she wasn't trying to flush Valium down the&nbsp;toilet like it seemed on the show. She explained, "But it wouldn’t have crossed my mind to flush Valium, because I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong. It’s anti-anxiety medication. It’s like, it’s five milligrams of Valium! It was just disappointing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hannah feels that she was made to look bad on the show because she has anxiety and she doesn't think that is fair for others who struggle with the same thing. She told&nbsp;Decider, "It’s anti-anxiety medication. I think I’ve just been really disappointed because I feel I’m being painted as some sort of drug addict or what have you. Which is just so sad, because there are so many people in the world that suffer from mental illness. And it’s 2020. We shouldn’t be making people feel like a lesser for taking medication for mental illness. Or making them feel like they can’t do a job, or they can’t do what normal people can do."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Craziest Moments Of Below Deck Mediterranean Season 4, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=hannah-s-happy-life>Hannah's Happy Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hannah-Ferrier-pregnant.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A fan responded in the Reddit thread and shared that because Hannah is expecting a baby and seems super happy now, that could explain this storyline.
