With the girls groups and boys groups, the flared pants and the backwards hats. Everyone was “like, duh” and “as if, whatever” was said way more than it needed to be. The years that we developed our favorite teen crushes like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danielle Fishel</a> playing Topanga from Boy Meets World or even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pam Anderson</a> on Baywatch. These are the years where we began to realize “hmm, that person attracts me.” It’s okay, we’ve all been there.</p><p>Another good thing the 90s gave us was movies. There were SO many movies. And the best part about these movies was how they totally depicted our everyday lives. The bullies, the high school parties, the mean girl that is really a nice girl with a tough exterior. It’s like, how are you living my life right now!? But there did come a point when we were like seriously, not another teen movie. And then boom! Not Another Teen Movie comes out. No, really. How did you read my mind?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not Another Teen Movie is a parody movie of all the teen movies that we got tired of seeing. Starring <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Evans</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chyler Leigh</a>, this 2001 film gives us a mix-up of our favorite teen flicks including (obviously) She’s All That, Ten Things I Hate About You, Pretty in Pink, and scenes from The Breakfast Club. It’s been almost 16 years since this movie hit the big screen, and here’s what the cast of Not Another Teen Movie is up to now.</p><p>(Actor Ron Lester who played Reggie Ray will not be included in the list. Lester passed away in 2016 as a result of liver and kidney failure.)</p><h2 id=janey-briggs-chyler-leigh>Janey Briggs – Chyler Leigh</h2><p>Chyler Leigh plays the main character role of Janey, the geeky art student that goes from geek to chic with the removal of her glasses and ponytail. Her character is (again, obviously) based off of the character Laney Boggs from She’s All That played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachael Leigh Cook</a>. Leigh went on to play little sister Lexie Grey in the ABC show Grey’s Anatomy. She started out as a guest in season 3 but was bumped up to the main cast in season 4 and stayed until her departure in season 8. A few years and a few roles later, she’s now one of the main characters on the CW show Supergirl playing character Alex Danvers. Leigh married former cast mate Nathan West back in 2002 and together they have three kids. Fun fact, West proposed to Leigh on the set of Not Another Teen Movie and the moment will make you cry. It’s beautiful, really.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=priscilla-jaime-pressly>Priscilla – Jaime Pressly</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaime Pressly</a> plays Priscilla, the hot cheerleader that leaves Jake for a weird, but attractive for some reason, Les. Her character is based off of Taylor Vaughan from She’s All That and Bring It On characters Torri and Big Red (she’s captain, and she steals the rival school’s cheers). Pressly went on to play Joy Turner in the hit show My Name is Earl, for which she was nominated for two Emmy awards. She won in 2007 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She stayed on with the show until its end in 2009. Since the show’s cancellation, she’s appeared on other shows and movies including Joe Dirt and I Hate My Teenage Daughter. Her most recent role began in 2014, starring as Jill Kendall on the CBS show Mom with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Faris</a>. Pressly has one child from a past relationship and is currently pregnant with twins with her longtime boyfriend Hamzi Hijazi.</p><h2 id=catherine-wyler-mia-kirshner>Catherine Wyler – Mia Kirshner</h2><p>Mia Kirshner plays Catherine, Jake’s sister who’s weirdly attracted to him. Gross. Her character is based off of Mackenzie Siler from She’s All That and also Kathryn Merteuil (played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>) from Cruel Intentions. Though obsessed with her brother, Catherine “helps” him with Janey’s makeover by removing her glasses and ponytail. Kirshner went on to play the recurring role of a terrorist on the show 24 for four seasons and, at the same time, the lead role of Ruby Cates in the show Wolf Lake. Wolf Lake only lasted one season, with four episodes of nine not airing. Afterwards, she went to star in the Showtime TV show The L Word as Jenny Schecter until the show’s ending in 2009. Since then she’s been doing small roles in various films and shows. She’s been pretty secretly living her personal life, so there’s not much to report there. But she is alive and well, so that’s a good thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sandy-sue-joanna-garcia>Sandy Sue – JoAnna Garcia</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JoAnna Garcia</a> plays Sandy Sue, the new girl that has Tourettes that ends up making the cheer squad. Her character is based on Sandy from Grease. One of Garcia’s earlier roles, before the Teen Movie, was Samantha on Nickelodeon’s Are You Afraid of the Dark?&nbsp;Years after her departure from the SNICK show, Garcia pops up as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reba McEntire</a>’s daughter Cheyenne on the WB show Reba. She played the Cheyenne role for the duration of the show, from 2001 to 2007. In 2008, Garcia starred in the CW show Privileged with co-star Lucy Hale. The show only lasted one season and was cancelled in 2009. She currently guest stars on the ABC show Once Upon A Time, beginning in 2013 and her latest role was the lead character’s wife in the 2017 film Fist Fight. Garcia has been married to MLB baseball player Nick Swisher since 2010 and have two daughters together.</p><h2 id=amanda-becker-lacey-chabert>Amanda Becker – Lacey Chabert</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lacey Chabert</a> plays Amanda Becker, the perfect girl whom Janey’s younger brother Mitch (Cody McMains) has a huge crush on. Her character is based off of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Love Hewitt</a>’s character Amanda Beckett in Can’t Hardly Wait. Chabert made her debut as a child actress in Party of Five and also voiced Eliza Thornberry in the animated TV show The Wild Thornberrys. A little known fact, she also voiced Meg Griffin of Family Guy in the first season before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mila Kunis</a> took over the role. Also, who could forget her role as Gretchen Weiners in Mean Girls? Along with the rest of the mean girls, Chabert won the 2005 Best On-Screen Team award. Chabert is married to David Nehdar as of 2013 and together they had their first child in 2016. Chabert is also very open about her faith and relates to her character in the 2013 film Christian Mingle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kara-fratelli-samaire-armstrong>Kara Fratelli – Samaire Armstrong</h2><p>Samaire Armstrong plays Kara Fratelli, one half of the Fratelli sisters joined at the head. I’m not really sure who these characters are based on. Maybe someone said “hey, you know what would make this movie even better? Twins joined at the head.” Not Another Teen Movie was actually Armstrong’s debut film role, though she began her acting career a little earlier, guest starring as Meredith in Party of Five. After Teen Movie, Armstrong snagged a recurring role on The O.C. as Anna Stern for three years, and also a recurring role as Emily on Entourage. In 2006, she costarred in the horror film Stay Alive as Abigail. The film was mildly successful, but did turn a profit versus its $9 million budget. In 2007, she checked in and out of an outpatient facility because of “personal issues” and a few years later she gave birth to her son with then-boyfriend Jason Christopher.</p><h2 id=sara-fratelli-nectar-rose>Sara Fratelli – Nectar Rose</h2><p>Nectar Rose (yes, that is her real name) plays Sara Fratelli, the other half of the conjoined Fratelli twins. Seriously, how hard must it have been to play this role? I wonder how much makeup was involved. And then, the dance scene with Chris Evans? That’s good acting, people. Though there isn’t much to find out about Rose’s personal life (I’m sure she’s kept it that way), she has a list of roles that are either uncredited or just not important at all. Her filmography features character names like stewardess or girl, or cheerleader. Her first role was that of a dancer in the 1996 film Independence Day featuring <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Smith</a>. She also appeared on Two and a Half Men and a more “known” role as Lenore in the film Serenity. Oh, and she played Eva in the 2006 film Roman. Honestly, who knows what Nectar Rose is up to these days. If you happen to find out, please let us know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=areola-cerina-vincent>Areola – Cerina Vincent</h2><p>Cerina Vincent plays Areola (ha), the naked foreign exchange student. Her character is based on Nadia from American Pie. Before her nude role, which wouldn’t be her last time showing off her goodies, she was cast as the Yellow Galaxy Ranger on Power Rangers Lost Galaxy. After the Teen Movie, she starred in the 2003 horror film Cabin Fever. She wanted to make sure that she wasn’t over-exposing herself and was afraid that she would get typecasted as the “naked girl.” In 2005, she starred in the film It Waits. The movie didn’t receive the greatest reviews and it went straight-to-DVD. She’s currently working on the Disney show Stuck in the Middle as mom Suzy Diaz. Outside of acting, Vincent has written three books with co-writer and friend Jodi Lipper and the pair also write for The Huffington Post.</p><h2 id=slow-clap-instructor-melissa-joan-hart>Slow Clap Instructor – Melissa Joan Hart</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa Joan Hart</a> plays the girl that gives the guy that tries to start the slow clap advice on how to and when to actually start one. She doesn’t have a name, and we’re not exactly sure why she has a cameo appearance but she does and that’s that. Hart was mostly known for her early star roles in Clarissa Explains It All and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. The Clarissa role lasted for three years and Sabrina for seven. Her latest huge role was that of Mel Burke on Melissa & Joey. The show ran for five years. Hart and her husband Mark Wilkerson have a fashion line together called King of Harts. More recently, she’s been in a political spotlight endorsing Mitt Romney in 2012 as a Republican and in 2016, she endorsed Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson. She also joined his campaign as the Connecticut chairperson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=flight-attendant-molly-ringwald>Flight Attendant – Molly Ringwald</h2><p>At the end of Not Another Teen Movie, we get a special guest appearance from Ms. Sixteen Candles herself, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Molly Ringwald</a>. Starring in Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Pretty In Pink, it’s fitting how she would make an appearance in a film that makes fun of all three. Ringwald’s character is a smart mouth flight attendant who calls out Jake for quoting movies while trying to keep Janey from getting on the plane to Paris. She earned an MTV Award nomination for the role. She didn’t win. Since the movie, she’s continued to star in and be featured in several television shows and movies including the parental role in the show The Secret Life of the American Teenager. The show ran from 2008 to 2013, and Ringwald sang the opening theme song “Let’s Do It (Let’s Fall in Love).” She is currently married to writer Panio Gianopoulos and they have three children together.</p><h2 id=jake-wyler-chris-evans>Jake Wyler – Chris Evans</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Evans</a> stars in Not Another Teen Movie alongside Chyler Leigh as Jake Wyler, the handsome jock that isn’t the best at making decisions. His role is based on Zack Siler (played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Freddie Prinze Jr.</a>) from She’s All That and Jonathan Moxon from Varsity Blues. Evans is most known for his role as Captain America, but his success comes years before he began protecting his country. Evans played the role of Johnny Storm, the Human Torch in the 2005 and 2007 Fantastic Four films. He was nominated for both MTV and Teen Choice awards for his character. He was also his own stuntman in the film Push. Then his biggest role came in Captain America: The First Avenger and he’s been starring in the red, white and blue since. He recently starred in Spider-Man: Homecoming and he’s currently still working on at least two more Avengers films. Get excited.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ricky-lipman-eric-jungmann>Ricky Lipman – Eric Jungmann</h2><p>Eric Jungmann plays Ricky Lipman, the best friend that’s in love with Janey and isn’t afraid to show it at any given opportunity. But the feeling isn’t reciprocated and you would think that would stop him from trying. Not this guy. The character of Ricky is based on Duckie Dale from the film Pretty in Pink. Jungmann was working as a cast member on the Disney show Even Stevens when he took on the role of Ricky. One of his major roles was playing photographer Jain McManus on the short-lived TV series Night Stalker alongside Stuart Townsend and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabrielle Union</a>. He’s also gone on to play a few other minor roles in television and film, including NCIS and CSI: Miami. He’s been missing from the acting scene for a little while now, and he is currently dating actress Brit Sheridan.</p><h2 id=austin-eric-christian-olsen>Austin – Eric Christian Olsen</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Olsen</a> plays Austin, Jake’s teammate and frenemy. He tricks Jake into telling Janey about the bet and ends up taking her to prom. What a jerk, right? Olsen got his first star role in the 1999 TV movie Arthur’s Quest and soon after landed another starring role on the short-lived Fox TV show Get Real. His role in Not Another Teen Movie was his second on the big screen. He’s continued his acting role with movies Beerfest and The Back-Up Plan. In 2010, he started working as Detective Marty Deeks, a recurring cast member on NCIS: Los Angeles, and became a main cast member in season two. The show is currently still running. He’s currently working on the tennis film Battle of the Sexes with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Carell</a> and is married to actress Sarah Wright. Together, they have two children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=malik-deon-richmond>Malik – Deon Richmond</h2><p>Deon Richmond plays Malik, the token black guy that usually says the same three things outside of his random spouts of wisdom. Richmond began acting at an early age as Kenny, Rudy’s friend, on the TV show The Cosby Show. He appeared on the show from 1986 to its end in 1992. He also appeared as a young <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie Murphy</a> in the beginning of Murphy’s Raw stand-up special. After the show, he went on to star in Getting By, an ABC sitcom. That was short-lived. One of his major roles was as the boyfriend of Tamera on Sister, Sister. Since, he’s been taking on smaller roles. His latest was as Gus’ new boss on the series finale of the show Psych in 2014. Richmond has twin daughters, and that’s all we know about him currently.</p><h2 id=prom-band-good-charlotte>Prom Band – Good Charlotte</h2><p>Little known fact, or for those that weren’t paying attention, Good Charlotte was the band that was playing at the Not Another Teen Movie prom. The band, lead by brothers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel</a> and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Benji Madden</a>, performed a rendition of “I Want Candy” while the high schoolers broke out their best moves and sang Paul Anka’s “Put Your Head on My Shoulder” for the king and queen(s) dance. Good Charlotte is probably one of the widest known punk rock bands ever. Their album released after their appearance in&nbsp;Teen Movie, The Young and the Hopeless went triple platinum selling over 5 million copies. They’ve released several more albums and appeared on a few other projects including American Idol and The Tonight Show. The band announced they would be going on a hiatus in 2011, and returned to music four years later finally releasing their album Youth Authority in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWawoJWnsm6t0Z5kraCVrnqvu9Zmq6GdXZiutMCMqJ1mpp%2BpeqK6zq2fnqpdqbKmuoympq%2BhlWQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tin-man-s-oil-can-from-wizard-of-oz-expected-to-sell-for-200-000.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tin Mans Oil Can From Wizard Of Oz Expected To Sell For $200,000</a>
