But before Melania was thrust into the limelight of politics, she worked as a model. Melania was a wanted entity in Paris and Milan and was doing well with her career.</p><p>In 1996, Melania moved from the fashion hubs in Europe and started a life in New York City. While there, she continued with her modeling career, appearing on the covers of publications like InStyle, New York Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, British GQ, and more. Melania is no stranger to print work or being put front and center of magazines to sell copies.</p><p><a href=#>When Melania met Donald in 1998, she admitted their encounter was inappropriate</a>. However, Melania was intrigued and eventually married Donald in 2005 in <a href=#>a marriage that Melania claims is equal between the two</a>. The month after the wedding, Melania appeared on the cover of Vogue in her wedding dress. Many thought that she would appear on the cover after becoming first lady., something that has become a tradition over the years.

However, many have a hard time believing the two are friends.</span><p>While some may question Melania's absence from the coveted publication, Melania Trump has a specific theory about why she did not get a Vogue cover as the first lady, and she didn't mince words when asked about it. Here is why Melania believes she did not get the cover of Vogue, the opportunity that Melania was offered by the publication, and why Melania's party affiliation may have precluded her from ever getting the cover of Vogue.</p><h2 id=melania-trump-believes-that-she-did-not-get-the-cover-of-vogue-because-the-publication-is-quot-biased-quot>Melania Trump Believes That She Did Not Get The Cover Of Vogue Because The Publication Is "Biased"</h2><h3 id=melania-trump-claimed-that-vogue-only-chose-particular-first-ladies-to-be-on-the-cover-and-specifically-excluded-others>Melania Trump claimed that Vogue only chose particular first ladies to be on the cover and specifically excluded others</h3><p>Before Melania was the first lady, there was a tradition of putting first ladies on the cover of Vogue. Hillary Clinton was on the cover once and Michelle Obama was on the cover three times. After Melania, Jill Biden was on the cover. Even Kamala Harris was a cover girl for the publication.</p><p><strong>But in the four years that Melania was in the East Wing of the White House, she never received the distinction</strong>, and in an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melania explained why she thinks she didn't get a cover</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They're biased. They have likes and dislikes and it's so obvious and I think everyone see it," Melania stated when asked about the Vogue cover. "I have much more important things to do and I did in the White House than being on the cover of Vogue."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar50437735-1.jpg><p>Melania went on to say, "People I see always criticize me whatever I do and I'm used to that. I move forward and I'm here to helping people and that is the mission."</p><p>Not being included in the group of first ladies who were profiled in Vogue did not appear to upset Melania after she was no longer in the White House. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald doubled down on the subject in September 2023</a> when he was asked about Melania's absence from the cover by Megyn Kelly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Can you believe it? Can you believe it? She was on the cover of Vogue before she met me," Donald said about Melania. "But once I said I'm running for president, that was, that was the end of the cover."</p><p>Donald went on to say, "And it's so sad. But she doesn't care. She's been on the cover of the magazines for a long time, and she was on the cover of Vogue before. And she was actually very friendly with [Vogue editor] Anna Wintour. But once I ran for politics, that was the end of that.

In it, not only does <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winston Wolkoff claim that Melania was offered the opportunity to be in Vogue</a> but she states Melania turned the publication down because they could not "guarantee" her the cover.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar50441225-1.jpg><p>"Vogue reached out to Melania, hoping to schedule an Annie Leibovitz photo shoot of the First Lady in the White House, with writer Rob Haskell shadowing her for a few days to write a profile," Winston Wolkoff wrote.

The first was that Donald tended to be very polarizing to the core audience and having Melania on the cover likely would not have helped the publication sell.</p><p>Secondly, Melania's Republican Party affiliation all but made the possibility of being on the cover dead in the water, given that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue historically puts Democrat first ladies on the cover, but not Republicans</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar50449653-1.jpg><p>Since Vogue was first published in 1892, it has never put a Republican first lady on the cover. Many have appeared inside the pages of the magazine but have never been offered top billing for the publication. Cases in point, according to Fox News, Nancy Reagan, Laura Bush, and Barbara Bush were featured in the magazine but were never cover ladies.
