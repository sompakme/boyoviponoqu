Chris Hemsworth)</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam Hemsworth (who's Chris Hemsworth's brother)</a>&nbsp;announced their divorce, just eight months after tying the knot in a small wedding ceremony in Tennessee. Fans were completely blindsided by the split. Since they had just tied the knot, many were under the impression that these two were going to spend the rest of their lives together, particularly since they had already shared an eight-year, on-off relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After their split, there was gossip that Miley was wasting no time moving on from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hunger Games</a> star. In fact, she was spotted making out with Brody Jenner's ex-wife, Kaitlynn Carter. Sources claimed that Miley and Kaitlynn were seeing one another, but their relationship didn't last long. Cyrus would soon fall head over heels in love with the blonde Aussie hunk, Cody Simpson, before announcing her plans to drop a seventh studio album sometime in 2020.</p><p>What else has Miley been up to since calling it quits Liam Hemsworth? Here's what you need to know.</p><h2 id=she-signed-a-new-management-deal><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>She Signed A New Management Deal</span></h2><p>In February 2020, it was revealed that Miley Cyrus had parted ways with her longtime management company, CAA, to sign with William Morris Endeavor Entertainment instead. The timing seems perfect since Miley is finalizing her seventh studio album. Her new management team will be there to help when she drops the new record.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-dated-brody-jenner-s-ex-kaitlynn-carter><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She Dated Brody Jenner’s Ex Kaitlynn Carter</span></h2><p>Following her split with Liam during the summer of 2019, Miley wasted no time starting a new relationship - this time, it was with a woman named Kaitlynn Carter, whom&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was seen kissing</a> while on vacation in Italy. Carter had just ended her marriage with Brody Jenner, so she could relate to what Miley was going through. Their relationship was in full swing for a couple of weeks before they decided to call it quits.</p><h2 id=she-released-a-song-about-her-marriage-downfall><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She Released A Song About Her Marriage Downfall</span></h2><p>After calling it quits with Liam, Miley went on to release an emotional ballad titled, "Slide Away". In the song's lyrics, she talks about a relationship that has run its course. While she never revealed whether the track was about her marriage, it seemed pretty obvious, given all of the clues in the song, along with the fact that she released it in the wake of their split.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprising Things Other Stars Have Said About Miley Cyrus (Good And Bad)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-started-dating-another-aussie><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Started Dating Another Aussie</span></h2><p>Miley Cyrus clearly wasn’t wasting any time after her relationship with Liam ended - just weeks after her romance with Kaitlynn had reportedly ended, she was seen getting cozy with Australian singer, Cody Simpson. By October 2019, the couple confirmed they were seeing one another, and they’ve been together ever since.</p><h2 id=she-shaved-cody-s-head-during-the-covid-19-pandemic><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Shaved Cody’s Head During The COVID-19 Pandemic</span></h2><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Miley and Cody Simpson have been isolating together. In April 2020, the former Hannah Montana star shocked fans when she was seeing shaving her boyfriend’s head in an Instagram video posted on Simpson’s page. Apparently, he’d been wanting to sport a new look for some time, and since getting a professional haircut amid the global pandemic was impossible, Miley played hairdresser.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-collaborated-with-ariana-grande-and-lana-del-rey><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Collaborated With Ariana Grande And Lana Del Rey</span></h2><p>In September 2019, Miley joined forces with Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey for the ultimate collaboration. They collaborated on the song, ‘Don’t Call Me Angel.’ The track was lifted from the poorly-received Charlie’s Angel’s reboot, and though the film bombed at the box office, fans were obsessed with ‘DCMA’ and its visually appealing music video. The song went on to peak at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><h2 id=she-dispelled-engagement-rumors-with-cody><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Dispelled Engagement Rumors With Cody</span></h2><p>Just weeks after going public with Cody Simpson, Miley was seen sporting what appeared to be an engagement ring, leaving fans wondering whether she was honestly looking to tie the knot again - especially since it hadn’t even been more than six months since she announced her divorce from Liam. However, it turned out that the ring Miley was sporting on her wedding finger was actually just a piece of jewelry owned by Cody. She liked it enough to wear it on a day out. Phew.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Facts About Miley Cyrus’ Past Don’t Paint Her In The Best Light</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-had-thanksgiving-dinner-at-her-family-s-house><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Had Thanksgiving Dinner At Her Family’s House</span></h2><p>In November 2019, Miley’s younger sister, Noah Cyrus, posted a photo of herself having Thanksgiving dinner with her family - and interestingly enough, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cody Simpson also happened to be there</a>. Just a month before their get-together, Simpson and Cyrus announced their relationship, so it seemed fairly soon for the pop star to be introduced to his girlfriend’s parents.</p><p>By the looks of things, the Cyrus family absolutely loves the 23-year-old and certainly approves of his relationship with Miley.</p><h2 id=she-launched-her-own-online-talk-show><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Launched Her Own Online Talk Show</span></h2><p>Amid the Coronavirus health crisis, Miley announced in March 2020 that she was going to launch her very own online talk show, with celebrity guests, interviews, and Q&A sessions. She wanted to do her part to encourage people to stay at home. The show, which had been airing Monday to Friday, featured famous people, including Elton John, Hailey Bieber, Selena Gomez, Dua Lipa, and Reese Witherspoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-sold-her-house-near-liam-s-property><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Sold Her House Near Liam’s Property</span></h2><p>In February 2020, it was revealed that Miley had sold her $2.5 million, fire-damaged Malibu home, which is opposite Liam’s pad. She purchased the mansion in 2016, but following her divorce from Liam, she sold the property for measly $1.7 million., according to MSN.

Work on this record began in 2017. It’s been a work in progress for the singer, who has already released two songs from the record - "Mother's Daughter" and "Slide Away" - but fans are still waiting for the former Disney star to confirm a release date for the highly-anticipated project. It appears to be delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The album, which features production work from Mark Ronson and longtime collaborator, Mike Will Made-It, is expected to hit stores later this year.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus Stays Sober Amid Temptation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoqSVrnqkxdGuqmaZlqmys3nDoq2oqpOaeqe%2BzqZkpaGRonqpscysrqiqpJ18</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jed-york-net-worth-how-much-is-york-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jed York Net Worth How Much is York Worth?</a>
