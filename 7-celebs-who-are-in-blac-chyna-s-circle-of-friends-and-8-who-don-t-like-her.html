However, following their split just one year later, it seemed as if the TV star had found herself making a lot of enemies in Hollywood - including the Kardashians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s not been an easy journey for the mother of two, who was said to have been heartbroken after her ex-boyfriend, Tyga, dumped her to be with Kylie Jenner.</p><p>Many assumed that Chyna was trying to get back at Kylie by getting with her half-brother and subsequently having a baby with him. Whatever her intentions were, Blac Chyna has burned bridges in Hollywood that she’ll never be able to rebuild. But it goes without saying that despite the scandals, Blac Chyna hasn’t necessarily lost every friend.</p><p>The TV personality mostly sticks with the people who have been by her side for years, which explains her close bond with the likes of Amber Rose and Nicki Minaj.</p><p>But who else is part of her circle of friends...and who isn’t?</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner---feud><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Kylie Jenner - Feud</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kylie Jenner has never really been friends with Blac Chyna, even when they appeared to squash their beef and pose for a selfie, just to make fans think everything was fine between the two.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>The truth is that Kylie had an issue with Chyna going after her half-brother, Rob, which seemed like a tactical move to get back at the reality star for “stealing” her man, rapper Tyga.</span></p><h2 id=rob-kardashian---feud><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Rob Kardashian - Feud</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, Rob Kardashian has been feuding with Chyna ever since the former couple went their separate ways for good, just over two years ago. In January of 2020, however, the USC graduate took things to new heights by filing for primary custody of their daughter, Dream.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rob&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed in court documents</a> that Chyna has a problem with substance and alcohol abuse.</span></p><h2 id=tyga---feud><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Tyga - Feud</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Blac Chyna’s other baby daddy, Tyga, isn’t on good terms with her, either. Aside from their feud, which erupted during his romance with Kylie, Chyna had also blasted the “Rack City” hitmaker for allegedly failing to make child support payments on time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Tyga and Chyna aren’t friends, but they’re trying to make things work for the sake of their son.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alexis-skyy---feud><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Alexis Skyy - Feud</span></h2><p>It’s not clear what initially ignited the feud between Blac Chyna and reality star, Alexis Skyy, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">following their scuffle</a> in January 2019, it was apparent that the two were better off keeping their distance from one another.</p><p>Alexis went on to spark romance rumors with Rob Kardashian, just days later when sock designer Rob live-streamed her doing a little cooking in his kitchen.</p><h2 id=soulja-boy---feud><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Soulja Boy - Feud</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Just weeks after going public with their romance, Blac Chyna and Soulja Boy called it quits. They split in February of 2019. Unbothered by the split, the “Crank Dat” star retweeted an article about the split, along with a caption which indicated that the only thing that had interested him about Chyna was a certain body part.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Though he went on to apologize for the comment, Blac has completely shunned him from her life.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=future---feud><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Future - Feud</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Future and Blac Chyna had been seeing one another for a couple of months, but when she went public with their romance by getting his name tattooed on her hand, the rapper was quick to call it quits. Then, he made it clear he was single on Instagram.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A humiliated Chyna later got the tattoo removed - what an embarrassing thing to go through.</span></p><h2 id=jonathan-cheban---feud><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jonathan Cheban - Feud</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Though Jonathan Cheban was initially said to have gotten along with Blac Chyna, once she sued the Kardashian family and allegedly got physical with Rob, Kim’s best friend was done with her.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He even branded Chyna and her pal Amber Rose “ghetto street bullies” for how they treated Kylie while she was with Tyga.</span></p><h2 id=nicki-minaj---friends><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Nicki Minaj - Friends</span></h2><p>Nicki Minaj and Blac Chyna have been friends for years. Chyna is a former exotic dancer who has appeared in several of Nicki’s music videos, including 2010’s "Monster" and 2012’s “Come On A Cone.”</p><p>While it’s unclear how they first met, Nicki and Chyna have always supported one another in public and behind the scenes, which is refreshing to see amongst women in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Was Blac Chyna’s “Mystery Date” At The Oscars?

It was Amber who helped the reality star settle into her new home in Cali, while slowly but surely building her cosmetics empire. They’re both moms now, and when they do get together, it’s awesome. Even their kids bond with one another.</span></p><h2 id=wendy-williams---friends><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Wendy Williams - Friends</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Following her divorce from Kevin Hunter, Wendy Williams admitted that the single life has been treating her well.

But it’s believed that, even though they’re no longer romantically involved with one another, Chyna and Game have remained close friends.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They’re often seen partying together at the same events, and while some may think running into a former flame is awkward, the mother of two doesn’t see it as a big deal - especially when she still gets along with a guy.</span></p><h2 id=joseline-hernandez---friends><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Joseline Hernandez - Friends</span></h2><p>It’s not surprising that Joseline Hernandez is friends with Blac Chyna. The two were often seen partying at the same events and they both happen to follow each other on social media.</p><p>Fans have also noticed how Joseline often refers to Chyna as her “wife” under her Instagram photos, so their friendship must be pretty close.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything There Is To Know About Blac Chyna And Rob Kardashian’s Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=cardi-b---friends><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Cardi B - Friends</span></h2><p>Before Cardi B blew up with her smash hit, “Bodak Yellow,” it was Chyna who would often play the rapper’s music on her Instagram Story - many people say that's the reason why Cardi received so much attention to start with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, that’s an arguable statement, but Cardi did notice Chyna’s support and thanked her for it on social media.
