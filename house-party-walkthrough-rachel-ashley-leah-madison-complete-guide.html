You may remove the kettle and place it on the highest ring visible on the stove by hitting (CTRL).

Go to the right speakers and take it, then pull it down. Another neat light may be found here.</li><li>Head to the kitchen and garage, where you’ll find another natty lite next to a blue box on a shelf. Take it.</li><li>If you encountered Patrick when going upstairs, introduce yourself and volunteer to help.</li><li>Another natty light on the top shelf beside the bathroom door is decorative.</li><li>To obtain the painkillers, you must pass through the master bedroom, and as soon as you open the bathroom door, close it behind you to avoid being seen. Take the pills that were found atop a basket in a corner of the room.</li><li>Go to the bathroom and gather a basket, which you’ll lower for another natty lite. You’ll discover what you’re looking for behind it. For the time being, ignore the kettle’s whistling noise.</li><li>Get another natty lite by going to Brittney’s room and searching for a laptop on the left-hand side of the desk, as well as a bottle.</li><li>Toss the coffee into a cup, then back to the kitchen.

Frank will then hand it on to you.</li><li>Tell Patrick that the coffee he’s drinking is Irish coffee, and watch him sober up.</li><li>“Tell her you’re not afraid of Frank, look at these biceps,” you remark as you hand the thermos back to Rachel. Just make sure Frank isn’t in the vicinity.</li><li>Ask Rachel if she’s nervous, and she’ll respond with “believe me” and “that’s wonderful.” You can now inquire about Rachel’s phone number.</li><li>When Patrick returns, tell him to get his phone from Brittney and take it from him.</li><li>You can now ask Madison for Vickie’s phone number.

Turn it off and then back on again.</li><li>When the internet is back up, send her another hoax text: “flash the cute boy.” Find Rachel and follow her outside, then select “dancing in your bi” from the dialogue option “how her buddy knows you.” When she’s finished dancing. “Get nked for cute guy for 30 seconds,” use bogus texts once more.
