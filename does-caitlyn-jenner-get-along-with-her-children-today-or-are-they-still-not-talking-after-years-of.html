Caitlyn Jenner has six children.

And that includes what bond Caitlyn Jenner actually has with her children.</p><p>It seems that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caitlyn and Kylie Jenner have a better relationship</a> than Caitlyn does with Kendall Jenner. According to Buzzfeed News, Caitlyn was interviewed on the Him And Her podcast in 2019 and talked about seeing Kylie regularly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kylie-jenner-on-a-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Caitlyn said, "Kendall's very athletic. We kind of both had the same attitude towards life. I get on very well with the two of them, but Kylie and I just seem to be closer most of the time."</p><p>Caitlyn said quite a lot during that podcast interview. She also called Kendall "secretive" in comparison to her twin sister Kylie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/caitlyn-jenner-1.jpg><p>Caitlyn also said that she and Kylie often had dinner together. She explained, "Kendall's off kind of doing her thing. I had dinner last night at Kylie's house. We try to do that once a week, once every two weeks. I go over there and she always has these great meals prepared. She doesn't do them, but they're so good."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Think Kendall Jenner Missed Her Niece's Birth</a></span></p><p>It doesn't sound like there is any bad blood between Caitlyn and Kendall Jenner.

And while Caitlyn's words might have seemed a little bit harsh, she and Kendall don't seem to be fighting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-18.jpg><p>While Caitlyn was honest about how her connection to Kylie is different, she does seem to still care a lot about Kendall.

Sadly the infrequent exchanges felt more like staged photo opportunities than real bonding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cayley-stoker-brandon-jenner.jpg><p>Brandon said that he felt that the times he did see his parent were all about taking a holiday picture, not because Caitlyn wanted to be a big part of each other's lives.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Janice Dickinson Really Feels About Getting Labelled As The 'Caitlyn Jenner Lookalike'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandon added that as of 2020, he and Caitlyn saw one another more frequently. And Brandon Jenner's story seems to be similar to Cassandra Marino's.</p><p>Caitlyn and Cassandra Marino also seem to be in a happier place than they once were. Cassandra explained to People,</p><p>"My relationship with Caitlyn is much better ... but we still have a lot of work to do. We didn't talk for years, and now we see each other every couple of weeks and talk on the phone, which I am grateful for."</p><p>It sounds like there are still some hurt feelings among Caitlyn Jenner's children. And that definitely makes sense since it can take a long time to process these types of situations. As everyone knows, whether they are as famous as the Kardashian-Jenners are or not, sometimes family has trouble getting along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYrCitdOlsKdlmpq7r7HRZp6erF2WubC6xmauoqyYYrGiwcahq56qo2K8s3nAq5xmrJiaxm6%2F06KjpWWepMFuwMCloqKml2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kevin-nealon-net-worth-age-height-weight-family-wiki-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kevin Nealon Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a>
