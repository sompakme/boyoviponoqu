Some of <a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner's kids don't want to be on TV</a>, which makes sense given the many years that the Kardashian-Jenner family have been in the public eye. Caitlyn Jenner has six children.

And that includes what bond Caitlyn Jenner actually has with her children.</p><p>It seems that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caitlyn and Kylie Jenner have a better relationship</a> than Caitlyn does with Kendall Jenner. According to Buzzfeed News, Caitlyn was interviewed on the Him And Her podcast in 2019 and talked about seeing Kylie regularly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kylie-jenner-on-a-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Caitlyn said, "Kendall's very athletic. We kind of both had the same attitude towards life. I get on very well with the two of them, but Kylie and I just seem to be closer most of the time."</p><p>Caitlyn said quite a lot during that podcast interview. She also called Kendall "secretive" in comparison to her twin sister Kylie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/caitlyn-jenner-1.jpg><p>Caitlyn also said that she and Kylie often had dinner together. She explained, "Kendall's off kind of doing her thing. I had dinner last night at Kylie's house. We try to do that once a week, once every two weeks. I go over there and she always has these great meals prepared. She doesn't do them, but they're so good."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Think Kendall Jenner Missed Her Niece's Birth</a></span></p><p>It doesn't sound like there is any bad blood between Caitlyn and Kendall Jenner. Their personalities just might not mesh as well as Caitlyn and Kylie's do. That, of course, happens in every family. And while Caitlyn's words might have seemed a little bit harsh, she and Kendall don't seem to be fighting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-18.jpg><p>While Caitlyn was honest about how her connection to Kylie is different, she does seem to still care a lot about Kendall. According to Hello!

Brody married Kaitlynn Carter in June 2018, although the two broke up in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brody-Jennerand-Kaitlynn-.jpg><p>The couple talked about this on The Hills: New Beginnings and it sounds like it was really painful for both of them. Carter said that right before the wedding, they found out that Caitlyn wouldn't be there.</p><p>Brody said on The Hills reboot, âNot having my dad at the wedding, it was a bummer. Honestly, it really did hurt and I would have loved to have had her there. But she had better things to do.

And in March 2023, they shared that they are expecting a baby, according to Us Weekly. It doesn't appear that Caitlyn has spoken about the good news. And it's unknown if she will be part of Brody's life once he becomes a father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, a source explained to Page Six that while Caitlyn Jenner was considering running for Governor of California, Brody didn't want to talk about it in interviews.</p><p>Brody Jenner hasn't commented on his relationship with Caitlyn more recently.

Brandon wrote, âI didnât see my father more than half a dozen times between the ages eight and twenty-five. Sadly the infrequent exchanges felt more like staged photo opportunities than real bonding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cayley-stoker-brandon-jenner.jpg><p>Brandon said that he felt that the times he did see his parent were all about taking a holiday picture, not because Caitlyn wanted to be a big part of each other's lives.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Janice Dickinson Really Feels About Getting Labelled As The 'Caitlyn Jenner Lookalike'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandon added that as of 2020, he and Caitlyn saw one another more frequently. And Brandon Jenner's story seems to be similar to Cassandra Marino's.</p><p>Caitlyn and Cassandra Marino also seem to be in a happier place than they once were. Cassandra explained to People,</p><p>"My relationship with Caitlyn is much better ... but we still have a lot of work to do. We didn't talk for years, and now we see each other every couple of weeks and talk on the phone, which I am grateful for."</p><p>It sounds like there are still some hurt feelings among Caitlyn Jenner's children. And that definitely makes sense since it can take a long time to process these types of situations. As everyone knows, whether they are as famous as the Kardashian-Jenners are or not, sometimes family has trouble getting along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYrCitdOlsKdlmpq7r7HRZp6erF2WubC6xmauoqyYYrGiwcahq56qo2K8s3nAq5xmrJiaxm6%2F06KjpWWepMFuwMCloqKml2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kevin-nealon-net-worth-age-height-weight-family-wiki-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kevin Nealon Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a>
