Sajak was even presented with a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award for his time as the longest-running host of a television show, surpassing that of Bob Barker.</p><p>Given the success of Wheel of Fortune and the fact that it has remained a popular game show over the last several decades, Sajak has been paid well during his tenure for hosting. This is especially true given that Sajak works only four days per month, taping six shows each day.

What Seacrest is being paid for his hosting duties has not been disclosed. But given his fanbase, it will likely be something similar to that which Sajak makes. But what will not be similar is his net worth, given that Pat Sajak's net worth is surprisingly low despite his TV show salary.</p><h2 id=pat-sajak-39-s-net-worth-is-75-million>Pat Sajak's Net Worth Is $75 Million</h2><h3 id=pat-sajak-39-s-hosting-duties-on-wheel-of-fortune-and-licensing-his-likeness-to-slot-machines-has-earned-him-his-fortune>Pat Sajak's hosting duties on Wheel of Fortune and licensing his likeness to slot machines has earned him his fortune</h3><p>Sayjak has been the host of Wheel of Fortune for over 40 years. During his tenure on the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sajak has managed to amass a net worth of $75 million</a>. While this is a great deal of money, some believe that Sayjak should be worth more. Sayjak makes $15 million per year for his hosting duties, which equates to over $52,000 per show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-pat-sajak-flat-out-refuse-wheel-of-fortune-contestants-who-were-taller-than-him_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his salary as the host of Wheel of Fortune, Sajak also signed a contract to have his likeness attached to slot machines throughout the country. Because of this, Sajak earns another $10 million per year.</p><p>If this money was added up over the course of Sajak's career and his other game show hosting duties on shows like Super Password, Password Plus, Dream House, and more were not even factored in, Sajak would be a billionaire. Given that he is not, it is curious as to why Sajak is worth much less.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pat-sajak.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A Former Wheel Of Fortune Winner Sued The Show For Unaired Footage Of Pat Sajak</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Wheel Of Fortune contestant Will Wright underwent several surgeries after his time on the game show.</span><p>The answer comes from not what Sajak is making for his hosting duties now, but what he made when he first began hosting Wheel of Fortune.</p><h2 id=pat-sajak-39-s-salary-over-the-years>Pat Sajak's Salary Over The Years</h2><h3 id=pat-sajak-earned-quite-a-bit-less-than-he-earns-today-during-the-early-days-of-wheel-of-fortune>Pat Sajak earned quite a bit less than he earns today during the early days of Wheel of Fortune</h3><p>Over the course of his time hosting Wheel of Fortune, Sajak's salary has gone up.

How long Sajak earned $12 million is unclear. What is known is that Sajak's $15 million salary stayed steady for five years.</p><p>In 2021, it was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sajak renegotiated his contract through 2024</a>. What that renegotiation entailed was not made public. What was revealed is that Sayjak received a "consulting producer credit" for that extended contract. This means more money coming Sajak's way — so it would not be a surprise for Sayjak to have added another couple of million to his yearly salary with this added title.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This, in addition to the slot machines that Sajak receives money for, means that Sajak is bringing home a solid fortune every year to add to his net worth.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/vanna-white-and-pat-sajak-smiling.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Pat Sajak Flat-Out Refuse Wheel Of Fortune Contestants Who Were Taller Than Him?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Some fans think that Pat Sajak is so sensitive about his height that he won't let anyone taller than him on Wheel of Fortune.</span><p>It has yet to be announced whether Sajak plans on taking another job once Wheel of Fortune ends or if he is officially retiring.

While Sajak should make more than White given that he does the hosting duties, there was some controversy when it was exposed that while Sajak was making millions and renegotiating contracts, <a href=#>White had been at the same salary of $3 million per year for 18 years</a>.
