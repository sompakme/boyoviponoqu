She is a Hollywood superstar and a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood mom</a>. Lively’s success was no accident. It was the result of her determination to pursue projects and partnerships that reflect her passion and her dedication to certain causes.</p><p>Just to give you a better idea, here is an overview of what Lively has been up to since “Gossip Girl”. She has had so much going in her life, and a lot of it has been amazing!</p><h2 id=she-was-named-chanel-s-ambassador><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>She Was Named Chanel’s Ambassador</span></h2><p>In 2011, it was revealed that the actress would be starring in a campaign for Chanel’s Mademoiselle handbags. The late Karl Lagerfeld, who served as Chanel’s creative director, once told Vogue, “She's a kind of American dream girl. I think she will become a great actress. It [the shoot] was an easy job because everyone fell in love with her.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-collaborated-with-sprinkles-founder-candace-nelson-to-develop-a-cupcake-flavor-for-charity><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>She Collaborated With Sprinkles Founder, Candace Nelson, To Develop A Cupcake Flavor For Charity</span></h2><p>In a Facebook post, Sprinkles announced, “Blake Lively and Sprinkles founder Candace Nelson developed the S'more cupcake using Blake's favorite ingredients.

Along the way, she crosses paths with several people, including Lively’s character, Glenda. Unfortunately, the film got slammed by critics. The consensus was that its story “wavers between discomfitingly inappropriate and simply muddled”, according to Rotten Tomatoes.</p><h2 id=she-became-the-new-face-of-stella-mccartney><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She Became The New Face Of Stella McCartney</span></h2><p>In 2011, a source told Mail on Sunday, “Like Leonardo, Blake is an animal lover and believes in cruelty-free fashion so when she met Stella at the Met Ball last month she found they shared many of the same ideals.” The source added, “Stella thinks Blake would be the perfect brand ambassador for her company in America.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds: How They Keep Their Relationship Strong 10 Years Later</a></span></p><h2 id=she-appeared-alongside-salma-hayek-in-savages><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She Appeared Alongside Salma Hayek In “Savages”</span></h2><p>The film is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">directed by Oliver Stone</a>. Lively told Collider, “I love that it’s so different from everything that I’ve ever known or seen. I love that challenge. I love exploring worlds that are so unknown to me. And having somebody like Oliver made it such a great experience because he gave us so many opportunities. He gave us all the knowledge and information we needed.

Blake's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unique style and charisma</a> brings that allure to life in a very contemporary way.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Lively also issued her own statement, “I admire the qualities of the Gucci Première woman and feel honored to represent the fragrance.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-became-the-face-of-l-oreal><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Became The Face Of L’Oreal</span></h2><p>The makeup brand made the announcement on Instagram in 2013. In response, Lively issued a statement, saying: “I am thrilled and honored to join the incredible women who represent L'Oreal Paris. From the versatile and motivational Brand Ambassadors, to all the women who proudly wear L'Oreal Paris each day. I grew up with the inspiration of their message, 'We're worth it.' What an important value to instill in women. That beauty is rooted in confidence. That is key. That is why I'm so proud to be a L'Oreal Paris woman.”</p><h2 id=she-appeared-in-jay-z-s-music-video-for-on-the-run-featuring-beyonc><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Appeared In Jay-Z’s Music Video For “On The Run” Featuring Beyoncé</span></h2><p>In the video, Lively and Beyoncé have some lines together. At one point, Lively tells the singer, “That’s not you.” In response, Beyoncé remarks, “You don’t know who I am anymore.” This prompts Lively to ask, “What happens when it hits the fan?” Beyoncé then responds, “I love him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from Lively, the video also features Jake Gyllenhaal, Rashida Jones, Kidada Jones, Guillermo Diaz, Don Cheadle, Sean Penn, and Emmy Rossum.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively & Ryan Reynolds: 15 Facts About Their Biggest Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=she-took-on-a-starring-role-in-the-film-the-age-of-adaline><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Took On A Starring Role In The Film “The Age Of Adaline”</span></h2><p>Lively told Fresh Fiction, “This is the first movie that I read where I thought ‘I can’t not do this.’ I feel like magic doesn’t exist much in films these days unless it’s a superhero movie or it has wands. But that magic in humanity – magic in a quiet film – is very rare. The way this deals with time and love. Infinite amounts of time is so appealing, but if you get that alone, it’s not. Time is nothing without love.”</p><h2 id=she-starred-in-woody-allen-s-caf-society><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Starred In Woody Allen’s “Café Society”</span></h2><p>On working with Allen, she told The Guardian, “The movie you see is often very different from the movie you shoot. The magic comes together in post-production. But when you’re on a Woody Allen set, you look around and think: ‘We’re making a Woody Allen movie!’ He creates the environment around you. If there’s a band playing, it’s not someone turning on a boombox. It’s a band playing from the beginning of the take. You have to speak loudly.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-starred-in-the-thriller-the-shallows><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Starred In The Thriller “The Shallows”</span></h2><p>While discussing the film, Lively told The Guardian, “It was so emotionally demanding. With those isolation movies, there’s no one to talk to and you’re often not speaking much. You do 16-minute takes of going from happy to watching someone die, to screaming, to pain, to fighting. So you’re just physically drained at the end of the day.”</p><h2 id=she-agreed-to-star-in-the-intense-film-all-i-see-is-you><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Agreed To Star In The “Intense” Film “All I See Is You”</span></h2><p>This was the film that changed Lively’s perception of onscreen nudity. Lively told Vanity Fair, “I always find nudity distracting. I’m very in love with my husband, but if there’s a pair of boobs out, I’m a human being! You’re like ‘boobs!’ It doesn’t mean I’m lusting for them, [but] when there’s naked boobies, you look at them.”</p><p>The actress added, “I don’t remember a moment that we weren’t filming. It was the most intense film I’d ever been on.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Sweet Photos Of Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds Through The Years</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-starred-alongside-anna-kendrick-and-henry-golding-in-a-simple-favor><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Starred Alongside Anna Kendrick And Henry Golding In “A Simple Favor”</span></h2><p>The film is directed by Paul Fieg - Lively told ABC News, “What Paul does in his films in general is he creates two strong female characters who are polar opposite, who are often going head to head. Yet, there is no pettiness. They’re trying to take each other down. They’re also in complete awe of the other person.”</p><h2 id=she-has-been-actively-involved-with-the-organization-baby2baby><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Has Been Actively Involved With the Organization, Baby2Baby</span></h2><p>While explaining how she got involved with Baby2Baby, Lively told Vogue, “I was seeing from afar what Baby2Baby was doing, and I heard a This American Life story about a woman who after Hurricane Katrina was displaced.” She added, “Hearing this woman’s story struck me.”</p><p>In 2018, Lively attended a Mother’s Day party for the organization - she played with children while dressed up as a Disney princess.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-starred-in-the-2020-film-the-rhythm-section><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Starred In The 2020 Film “The Rhythm Section”</span></h2><p>For Lively, working on the film was extra special. While speaking with Refinery 29, the actress explained, “Having all female filmmakers is something that I've never experienced in my career. I was incredibly happy each day to be telling a woman's story, not through the male gaze, but through two women who really understood it and would fight for the experience that represents a multifaceted woman.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Throwback Pics Of Blake Lively Too Good To Ignore</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYq%2BtrcqeZKWhppq5unnHmqpmmpWau27Bz2arqGWjnruksYygpqyrmaV6qLXRpWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./inside-mariah-carey-s-5-6-million-atlanta-mansion.html>&#171;&nbsp;Inside Mariah Carey's $5.6 Million Atlanta Mansion</a>
