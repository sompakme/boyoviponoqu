Jones joined <strong><a href=#>Two and a Half Men</a></strong> at the age of nine, he had already created quite a resume for himself. From guest starring roles to commercials, Jones was an in-demand child actor. Landing the role of Jake on the hit sitcom, however, would prove to be Jones' biggest role to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the first time, there was the potential for Jones to have a long-term role if the series was picked up by CBS. Fortunately for the entire cast, the show was not only picked up but lasted for over a decade. And because of this, <a href=#>Jones amassed quite a fortune at a young age</a>.</p><p>Given the success of Two and a Half Men, Jones had the opportunity to watch his career skyrocket once the show had run its course. But before the series entered its final season, Jones made the decision to leave, citing a distaste for the storylines he was being provided.</p><p>With the $20 million he has amassed since breaking into the entertainment industry over 20 years ago, if Jones does not want to do anything work-related, he may just not have to as long as he has a good financial team on his side investing properly in his future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angus-t-jones-took-on-few-acting-gigs-after-two-and-a-half-men>Angus T. Jones Took On Few Acting Gigs After Two And A Half Men</h2><p>Had Jones wanted to take acting jobs to break into the world of acting as an adult, he would have had that opportunity in spades after Two and a Half Men concluded.</p><p>But as a result of a <a href=#>viral tantrum speaking out against the show that upset fans</a>, he was not thought of as highly by executives for projects on both the small and big screens, <a href=#>begging the question of whether Jones would ever act again</a>. As such, <a href=#>there has been only one acting job that Jones has landed</a> since his time on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/angus-t-jones-at-variety-s-5th-annual-power-of-youth-event-2012.jpg><p>In the year after Two and a Half Men aired, Jones appeared on the online miniseries, Horace and Pete. The role was small, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jones was handpicked for the role by the creator Louis C.K.</a> because of the similarities the character and actor had in common.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He walked off of 'Two and a Half Men' because he felt a moral conflict with the show and I found that really fascinating, that somebody walks away from a huge job because he doesn't feel right about it and that made me think about Horace and my show." Louis C.K. explained.</p><p>"I said, 'I want you to play a guy in a world that's very amoral but you're not.' ... And he came and he played that part."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Highest-Paid Child Star Angus T. Jones Has A Worth Of $20 Million Today But How Much Is His Home Worth?</a></span></p><p>Be it because acting jobs dried up after Jones' rant against Men, or he was completely disenfranchised by Hollywood, this role would mark the last one for Jones.</p><p>It is almost guaranteed that while he was paid, that paycheck was nothing close to the $350,000 per episode Jones was making during his later years on Men. As such, he had to look at different creative avenues to do so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=projects-angus-t-jones-had-lined-up-after-leaving-two-and-a-half-men>Projects Angus T. Jones Had Lined Up After Leaving Two And A Half Men</h2><p>After leaving Two and a Half Men, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jones wanted to share the word of God that he had recently found</a>. The way that Jones thought it best to do this was via "Bible-based stories." However, that did not pan out for Jones and the stories were never told via the small screen, an internet series, or published as books.</p><p>During his time away from Men, Jones attended college at the University of Colorado Boulder. While he did not earn a degree, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he did make a contact</a> that would put him on a track to get back into the entertainment industry without necessarily being in front of the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/angus-t-jones-jon-cryer-ashton-kutcher-two-and-a-half-men-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jones' contact from college was friends with Sean "Diddy" Combs' son, Justin Combs. The two realized that they "shared common ideas" and <a href=#>eventually became business partners for Tonite</a>, a company described by People as a "disruptive live events company," a company that produced events that "people had to attend to understand."</p><p>Unfortunately, it appears that Tonite was not the success that either Combs or Jones hoped it to be. To date, there is not any current information on the company and it appears that Combs has moved on to work with REVOLT TV as a host and executive producer.</p><p>The last update that Jones gave about a career was in 2020. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This time, he was no longer dealing with acting but instead, was dabbling in music</a>. "I do music now, go head get used to it loves," Jones captioned his last Instagram post.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Photos Of Angus T. Jones' Evolution Through The Years</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This, again, sounded like a promising career track for Jones to follow. But given that he was able to release just one song on Soundcloud with several other collaborators, this venture failed for Jones as well.</p><p>While it appears that Jones wants to find a path in life, the ones he has chosen to date have not been the most successful. But considering what he made in his younger days as an actor, this may not prove to be as problematic as it appears.</p><h2 id=what-angus-t-jones-is-doing-now-to-make-money>What Angus T. Jones Is Doing Now To Make Money</h2><p>By all accounts, it does not look like Jones is doing anything to make money. And for anyone who managed to amass the fortune that The Rookie star did as a child actor, Jones honestly does not need to do anything unless he wants to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/140318_atm_angus_jones_wg.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jones has been linked to philanthropic work</a>. This work was through Fist Star Organization which helped "abused and neglected children."</p><p>Jones has also been a supporter of St. Jude's Research Hospital and Be A Star, an anti-bullying foundation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Angus T.
