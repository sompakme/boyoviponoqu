Movies like Scream and <a href=#>I Know What You Did Last Summer</a> played a big part in this, as did <a href=#>Cruel Intentions</a>, which featured performers like Sarah Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon, and <a href=#>Ryan Phillippe</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Phillippe had multiple hits in the 90s that put him on the map, and it seemed like the actor was going to be an unstoppable force on the big screen. While he didn't have a career like Tom Cruise, Phillippe has remained busy since the 90s and has done and achieved far more than some people would suspect.</p><p>So, what has Ryan Phillippe been up to since Cruel Intentions? Let's take a closer look at the work that he has done since that movie helped make him a star.</p><h2 id=phillippe-became-a-film-star-in-the-90s>Phillippe Became A Film Star In The 90s</h2><p>As one of the major young stars who rose to prominence during the latter part of the 90s, Ryan Phillippe was seemingly unstoppable during that era. The actor was able to get several years of experience prior to breaking out, but once he was given the chance to shine, he broke into the mainstream and never looked back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>1997's I Know What You Did Last Summer was a huge box office hit that, along with Scream, helped breathe new life into the horror genre, specifically slasher films. Scream may have gotten more critical acclaim, but I Know What You Did Last Summer generated over $125 million at the box office, and its financial success wound up spawning an entire franchise of films.</p><p>Two years later, in 1999, Phillippe starred in Cruel Intentions with a bevy of young stars, much like he had in I Know What You Did Last Summer. The film might have gotten mixed reviews from critics, but after making over $70 million at the box office against a small budget, Phillippe had another sizable hit on his hands. Much like I Know What You Did Last Summer, this film caught on with younger audiences and became a staple of the decade in no time at all.</p><p>After breaking out in the 90s and becoming a star, Phillippe has remained quite busy on both the big and small screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>John Mayer Gets Trolled In Recent IG Post By Katy Perry's Rumored Ex, Ryan Phillippe</a></span></p><h2 id=he-39-s-appeared-in-movies-like-39-crash-39>He's Appeared In Movies Like 'Crash'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4EEB8FC4-9A61-4D32-92A2-B8C210AC21FE.jpeg><p>Two major hits got the ball rolling for Phillippe, and as the new millennium rolled around, the actor looked to capitalize on his newfound fame. 2001's Gosford Park was a modest hit for Phillippe, and after a string of smaller projects, the actor found himself in a critical darling after taking part in 2004's Crash. Phillippe, along with the rest of the cast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">won a SAG Award</a> for his performance in the film, and the picture itself won the Academy Award for Best Picture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From that point forward, Phillippe would continue to act in projects of all sizes. He appeared in movies like Flags of our Fathers, Stop-Loss, The Lincoln Lawyer, and more. It has been a mixed bag of success, but Phillippe has maintained steady work on the big screen, constantly showing what he can do while the cameras are rolling.</p><p>As nice as it has been for fans to see Phillippe in action on the big screen, the actor has made sure to do plenty of television work, as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Reese Witherspoon And Ryan Phillippe’s Divorce</a></span></p><h2 id=he-39-s-been-on-shows-like-39-shooter-39>He's Been On Shows Like 'Shooter'</h2><p>Before breaking out as a film star, Phillippe had done plenty of television work early on in his career. So, it shouldn't be too surprising to see that he has done a load of television work since the 90s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through the years, Phillippe has been on shows like Chicago Hope, The Outer Limits, Damages, Drunk History, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Will & Grace. That is an impressive list of credits, but these have been guest spots. Phillippe, however, has made sure to star on his own shows.</p><p>from 2016 to 2018, Phillippe starred on the series Shooter, which was based on the Mark Wahlberg film of the same name. The show was able to last for 31 episodes over the course of 3 seasons, and Phillippe did a solid job as the lead on the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's Reese Witherspoon And Ryan Phillippe's Relationship Like Today?</a></span></p><p>Currently, Phillippe is part of the main cast on Big Sky, which has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">been renewed</a> for a second season. Phillippe has a few projects on deck at the moment, staying as busy as ever. Needless to say, fans will be keeping a close eye on the actor to see what he does next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Inside The Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Phillippe And Amber Cornish Love Triangle</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipspmeYr2ptculoKmolWKup8DEq2ScqqWauW61za2cp6yZpLu0edahnKudXZa%2FpnnToZyyZZ6kxG5%2Bj2toaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./here-s-what-they-ve-been-doing-instead.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here's What They've Been Doing Instead</a>
