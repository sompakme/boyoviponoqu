href=#>it aired its first episode way back in 1975</a>), the show is also preparing for its most challenging season yet. Over the years, cast members have come and gone, with some launching their solo careers quite successfully (such as <a href=#>the likes of Tina Fey, Eddie Murphy, and Will Ferrell</a>, to name a few).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 15 Things The Saturday Night Live Crew Wants Us To Forget Already</a></span></p><p>And while the show has dealt with cast member exits in the past, Michaels has a reason to be more concerned this time around. Recent reports are suggesting that several SNL veterans may not re-up for season 47 and beyond. This includes Emmy-nominated actress Cecily Strong who has been striking out on her own, most recently starring in Apple TV+’s Schmigadoon!. Reports indicate that Michaels may be trying to persuade her to stay on. And as Strong decides whether she’s in or out, one can’t help but wonder what the actress’ relationship with Michaels is like behind the scenes.</p><h2 id=when-cecily-strong-came-on-she-lsquo-exploded-rsquo>When Cecily Strong Came On, She ‘Exploded’</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like Fey and fellow SNL veteran Amy Poehler, Strong was also working at iO in Chicago prior to joining the show. Chana Halpern, its founder, periodically holds auditions for improv actors, the most impressive of the bunch would then audition for Michaels. Unlike Fey or Poehler though, wasn’t working at iO as a performer at that time. Instead, Strong told Chicago Tribune that she had resigned her fate to “working the box office (at iO), babysitting and just being poor.” But then, Halpern gave her a much-needed nudge.</p><p>“I asked her, ‘Why haven’t you signed up for the showcase to be considered for Lorne?’” Halpern recalled. “I said ‘Let me give you a slot and see what you can do.’ If I hadn’t passed by the box office that night, she might still be answering phones.” The initial audition was followed by more auditions, screen tests, and meeting. Through it all, Strong confessed that she “cried a lot.” “It was something I’d dreamed about.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, the show invited Strong to come to New York and that’s how she found out that she had been cast. During her first season with SNL, it didn’t take long for Michaels to realize that he had a rising star. And when Strong returned for her second season, the SNL creator decided to make her an anchor of the popular segment Weekend Update. While speaking with The New York Times, Michaels even remarked, “Cecily, from the first show, was right there. She exploded.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To Molly Shannon’s Revealing Tragedy That Inspired Her ‘SNL’ Career</a></span></p><p>Since then, Strong has become one of SNL’s most recognizable stars. Over the years, she’s been known for portraying characters such as the Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started a Conversation with at a Party, Claire from HR, and Girlfriends Talk Show host Kyra. At the same time, fans also can’t get enough of Strong’s impression of Jeanine Pirro and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-she-missed-out-on-an-snl-show-from-home-lorne-michaels-was-supportive>When She Missed Out On An SNL Show From Home, Lorne Michaels Was Supportive</h2><p>When COVID-19 forced several shows and films to halt production, SNL decided to have the cast work on some episodes from home. For Strong, however, the timing of doing the episode didn’t work out for her. Emotionally, it didn’t seem that she could handle the job as she was dealing with anxiety and depression. At that time, her family was also celebrating what would have been her cousin, Owen Strong’s, birthday. He passed away in 2020 after battling brain cancer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian May Host ‘Saturday Night Live’, Reports Say</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Strong needed some time away from the show, Michaels readily understood her situation and allowed her to miss an episode. “She earned it,” Michaels explained. “This season was probably the hardest one ever for her.” As for Strong, she was very appreciative of Michaels’ gesture. “You know, luckily, I have producers there and and Lorne, too, and I feel very taken care of by the show,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress told NPR</a>. “It was only really one episode that I missed and I really wanted to be there. And I think they knew that about me.”</p><h2 id=can-lorne-michaels-convince-cecily-strong-to-return>Can Lorne Michaels Convince Cecily Strong To Return?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, the talks are continuing between Michaels and Strong. Michaels appears confident that he can convince on of his veteran stars to stay on SNL a little longer. “My hope is she’ll come back,” the SNL creator, who also executive produced Schmigadoon!, shared. “What I said to her, and what I believe, is that I don’t think she’s done yet.” That said, Michaels also acknowledged, “You can’t really get her to do something she doesn’t want to do.”</p><p>Meanwhile, if you ask Strong, she’s still unsure about her future with SNL. “I’m still thinking about it, to be honest,”<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the actress told Collider</a>. “I’m just not sure yet. I know it’s a boring answer, but that’s the truth.” Hopefully, she’ll choose to come back.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Real Reason Kanye West Was Permanently Banned From ’Saturday Night Live’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6tbTEZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWSmsG4scSnZKymnKh6rbvRp5xmpZmYtaKxy6xkmqaUYrCmr8ilsGarpKe8r7OMaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tommy-lee-net-worth-therichest.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tommy Lee Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
