In reality, however, the sad truth of the matter is that some people who get married have no business pledging that they will remain loyal to their spouse.Sadly for everyone involved, even though Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren got married, he didn’t remain faithful. In fact, it eventually came to light that Woods habitually cheated on Nordegren and one of his rumored mistresses became famous enough that people want to know <a href=#>what she is up to now</a>.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tiger Woods Mistress Receives Little Sympathy After She's Dragged On 'Wendy'</a></span>Even though Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren’s marriage didn’t last, it seems very unlikely that either of them regret their time together. After all, Woods and Nordegren share two kids, Charlie and Sam.Now that it has been years since Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren’s marriage came to an end, that has left some observers with questions. Most notably, how often does Woods see his two children?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-truth-about-tiger-woods-rsquo-relationship-with-his-kids>The Truth About Tiger Woods’ Relationship With His Kids</h2><p>Unfortunately, the majority of failed marriages result in a lot of extremely hurt feelings, to say the very least. While that is sad in any case, when ex-spouses don’t get along but they don’t drag anyone else into their mess the damage that can be done is limited.</p><p>Even though parents are supposed to always put the welfare of their children first, it can be hard for furious people to keep things in the right perspective. As a result, it isn’t overly surprising that <a href=#>some celebrity co-parents can’t agree on anything</a>, even though the resulting custody battles can be tragic for their kids.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kanye West And Kim Kardashian In 'Bitter Custody Battle' Over Where Their Kids Live</a></span></p><p>When the truth about Tiger Woods’ infidelity came to light, that must have been absolutely humiliating and heartbreaking for Elin Nordegren. If some people were in Nordegren’s position, they would have taken their anger out on Woods in any way they can.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for Tiger Woods and his kids, from all accounts, Elin Nordegren never made any attempts to cut Tiger Woods off from his kids. In fact, as it turns out, not only did Nordegren allow Woods and her children to remain close, when push came to shove she worked hard to make sure Tiger still got to see their kids.</p><p>In 2021, Tiger Woods got into an extremely serious car crash and even though <a href=#>he escaped legal troubles</a>, he was badly injured. As a result of the injuries he suffered, it became hard for Woods to get around which easily could have made it very difficuly for him to see his kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, an insider told People that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elin Nordegren worked hard to make sure Tiger Woods continued to see their kids</a> consistently following his accident.</p><p>"He sees the kids a lot. Maybe not every day, but almost every day. A lot of that is because of Elin, who is just amazing. She's been incredible since the crash. She has bent over backwards to make sure that he can see the kids while he recovers from his injuries."</p><p>When Tiger Woods isn’t recovering from a car crash, his role as a professional athlete and celebrity keeps him busy. As a result, it seems safe to assume that there may be periods in which he doesn’t see his kids almost every day. Still based on everything that is known, Woods is a constant presence in his children’s lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-tiger-wood-rsquo-s-girlfriend-get-along-with-his-ex-wife-and-children>Does Tiger Wood’s Girlfriend Get Along With His Ex-Wife And Children?</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, it is widely believed that Tiger Woods and Erica Herman have been a couple for almost five years.
