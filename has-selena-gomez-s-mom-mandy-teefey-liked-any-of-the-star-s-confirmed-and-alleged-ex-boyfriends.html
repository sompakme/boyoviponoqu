In the movie, Gomez talks about having lupus and bipolar disorder.</p><p>Teefey said, "We went through that and found healing. We've moved past some of it, and even if it's something she went through, and I didn't know she went through it, as a mother, it's going to affect me. It's going to hurt my stomach and put me in that mindset.
