And he kind of just — seems very uncomfortable.”</p><p>Jennifer Aniston told the story about the time they filmed the first Murder Mystery movie in Italy and how she and <a href=#>his wife, Jackie Sandler,</a> were dressed up to a nice dinner. “And [Sandler] shows up in basketball shorts.

What’s wrong with you?!’ ”</p><p>But Jennifer Aniston revealed she loves taking care of the 50 First Dates star, because “He’s so concerned with taking care of everybody else, which he really does.
