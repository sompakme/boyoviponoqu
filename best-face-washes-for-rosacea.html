It’s characterized by redness, swelling and often includes acne-like symptoms. It’s most common in those with fair skin. While rosacea is more common in females, it tends to affect males more severely. As it stands, the precise cause for rosacea remains unknown, we only know that it occurs more commonly between the ages of 30 to 50. Gentle cleansing is super important for those with rosacea as it’s the first step in soothing your skin, and helping to protect it from further damage. In saying this, the skin on the face is delicate and more prone to irritation in rosacea, so we recommend taking it gently and avoiding any scrubbing, rubbing, or exfoliating.</p><h2>What does it look like?</h2><p>Rosacea can vary in appearance from person to person, but there are some common shared symptoms. These include:</p><ul><li aria-level=1>Facial redness: This can appear as an ongoing ‘blush’ or patchy redness on the nose, cheeks, forehead and chin.</li><li aria-level=1>Visible blood vessels: Small, visible blood vessels may appear on the skin of the face.</li><li aria-level=1>Acne-like bumps: These small, red, pus-filled bumps can be mistaken for acne but are typically located in the central part of the face.</li><li aria-level=1>Eye problems: In some cases, rosacea can cause eye dryness, irritation and redness.</li></ul><h2>What are the potential causes and triggers?</h2><p>Despite rosacea being a condition that appears just on the skin of the face, it is not as simple as being a cosmetic condition. There isn’t a consensus yet on its specific cause, however there is ongoing research on a variety of interacting causes. These include:</p><ul><li aria-level=1>Overactive immune system: It’s thought that those with rosacea have an overactive immune system which can cause inflammation and contribute to the development of rosacea symptoms.</li><li aria-level=1>Abnormal blood vessels: Those with rosacea may have blood vessels that are more reactive or prone to inflammation, which can cause the facial redness or flushing associated with the condition.</li><li aria-level=1>Demodex mites: Demodex mites are a type of mite that lives in human hair follicles, and essentially everyone has them. In rosacea they are present in larger numbers – so the exact causative link is unknown, but they may play a role in triggering an immune response or inflammation.</li><li aria-level=1>Genetics: Rosacea tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic contribution to the condition. However, as with any component of genetics, the environment plays a large role in determining whether you’ll express symptoms.</li></ul><p>When it comes to triggers, these can vary from person to person, but it’s also important to be aware of them so you can try to minimize their effects. Triggers may include:</p><ul><li aria-level=1>Sun exposure: Harsh UV rays can cause skin damage and inflammation, leading to flare ups</li><li aria-level=1>Temperature extremes: Temperatures at both ends of the extremes can cause redness and flushing in people with rosacea. A surprising aspect of this is that even hot drinks can be a trigger, as your morning cup of coffee causes blood vessels in your face to dilate, resulting in flushing and redness.</li><li aria-level=1>Spicy food: Spicy foods can trigger rosacea, exacerbating flushing and redness.</li><li aria-level=1>Stress: As with many skin conditions, stress is a very common trigger. High levels of stress can cause inflammation, worsening rosacea symptoms. This makes it hugely important to prioritize your self care, and have ongoing stress management techniques.</li><li aria-level=1>Certain skin care products: Many skin care products contain harsh chemicals, or alcohol that can significantly worsen rosacea symptoms and overall cause lasting damage to the skin. Luckily, these are easy enough to avoid and you can opt for natural products with a straightforward list of ingredients.</li><li aria-level=1>Medications: Certain medications including blood pressure medications, steroids, hormonal medications or contraceptives, and topical acne medications, can cause flushing or dilation of the blood vessels either triggering or exacerbating the redness and inflammation seen with rosacea.</li></ul><h2>Is it treatable?</h2><p>—These include topical medications, oral antibiotics, laser therapy and lifestyle changes to avoid triggers. There may also be periods where symptoms improve and you can temporarily stop treatment. Finally, your doctor may give you advice on potential triggers to avoid, and stress management techniques to address underlying drivers of inflammation.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image3-1-1.jpg><p>Since their launch in 2022, Blu Atlas have quickly risen to be stars of the beauty scene for both males and females, and are particularly dominant in the category of facial products.</p><p>Volcanic ash, the star of the show in this face cleanser, is a unique ingredient that works to absorb excess oil and impurities from your skin.

It has a few key ingredients that help it to effectively target rosacea symptoms. Firstly, glycerin, a humectant that helps to hydrate the skin and prevent dryness. Rosacea is often characterized by a compromised skin barrier which can make the skin more sensitive and prone to irritation. To tackle this, La Roche-Posay uses ceramides. Ceramides are lipids that help to strengthen the skin’s barrier function and protect it from external stressors. Finally, niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) is used to target redness and inflammation, to soothe and calm the skin.</p><p>What do we love about La Roche-Posay? They’re recommended by over 90,000 dermatologists worldwide, and we can see why! With over 750 studies and at least 25 years of research, they are strict about standards and continue to deliver and innovate.</p><h3>4. <a href=#>Bioderma Sensibio Foaming Gel</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image11-10.png><p>Bioderma is a great option for rosacea for its deeply hydrating ingredients, including glycerin which helps to build up the skin’s hydration and reduce irritation. Mannitol is another powerful hydrating ingredient, working to soften and smooth the skin while also delivering anti-inflammatory effects. Coco-glucoside is a gentle cleansing agent, helping to remove dirt and oils for the skin, giving your face a fresh start. Coco-glucoside also mimics the structure of the skin, providing additional reinforcement. All of these combine to help bring back your skin’s natural homeostatic balance, and to protect it from potential irritants or rosacea triggers.</p><p>When it comes to their philosophy, Bioderma sees our precious skin as a whole ecosystem that is continually interacting with its environment, requiring ongoing care. Rather than adding harsh, potentially toxic chemicals, their vision is to work alongside the natural resources of your skin’s ecosystem to support them and recover their natural functions.</p><h3>5. <a href=#>Yes To Cucumbers Daily Gentle Milk Cleanser</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image6-11.png><p>Bring the spa day to your very own home with this gentle cleanser from Yes To Cucumbers.

It’s pH balanced, meaning it isn’t stripping your skin of its natural oils or disrupting the balance of your skin. Aloe, allantoin, and glycerin all combine to smooth the skin and provide deep hydration. As rosacea is commonly associated with dry patches on the skin, these ingredients unite to smooth and hydrate the skin.</p><p>First Aid Beauty pride themselves on being cruelty free, meaning they do not carry out any animal testing. Their full range was previously 100% vegan and while some products now contain animal products, the great news is that their face cleanser is fully vegan!

High in antioxidants, Vitamins A, E and Omega 3, your skin will be thanking you for all the hydrating and restorative benefits these ingredients provide.

Cherry juice is packed full of antioxidants, enabling it to fight off free radical damage in your skin. Aloe vera locks in these key ingredients with potent moisturizing abilities, helping to showcase all these benefits.

As the name suggests, one of the key ingredients in this face cleanser is soy. Rich in amino acids, soy helps to even out skin tone, reduce redness and reduce sun damage. Cucumber extract complements these anti-inflammatory effects, adding to the soothing nature of this cleanser. Finally, rosewater helps to neutralize the pH of the skin. You can choose between a gel, foaming, oil, rinse, or non rinse formula.</p><p>As a brand, Fresh is at the intersection of science, ancient rituals, and natural ingredients. This harmony has enabled them to create unique products that you didn’t know you needed!

Neem is a powerful ingredient that has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to treat a range of skin conditions, including acne and rosacea. It offers both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that fight off acne-causing bacteria, and reduce redness. Turmeric is another star ingredient known for its potent anti-inflammatory powers. It’s also great for evening, and brightening out skin tone, and helping to protect the skin from potential environmental stressors. Shea butter, rich in vitamins and essential fatty acids, completes the formula and helps to lock in these powerful ingredients.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Will a face wash get rid of my rosacea?</h3><p>While face washes can be hugely beneficial at addressing the symptoms of rosacea, they may not address the root cause. Since the exact cause is complicated, it’s best to consult your doctor or dermatologist to get their advice, particularly around links to inflammation. Everyone’s skin is different, so face washes can provide varying degrees of symptom relief. Regardless, they are a great addition to your routine to help protect the skin and boost your self care.</p><h3>Is rosacea associated with any other medical conditions?</h3><p>While rosacea is commonly understood as a cosmetic condition, given its links with inflammation and immunity, its relationship to other conditions becomes quite complex. It has been linked with diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, migraines and autoimmune conditions. Whether these are direct clinical links, or simply correlations is to be determined, but they’re important to keep in mind given the association of rosacea with your blood vessels, inflammation, stress, and immune system health. This may help you take preventative measures or lifestyle adaptations to boost your overall health.</p><h3>Rosacea has impacted my self-esteem – what should I do?</h3><p>Since rosacea doesn’t have a clear cause and course of treatment, it can be quite a challenging diagnosis to receive. In addition to this, the face obviously plays a huge role in our lives and interactions, our perceptions of ourselves, and how we are perceived too. While it’s typically easy to offer treatments to address physical symptoms, the side of medicine that is often lacking is that addressing the psychosocial impact of this condition. It’s quite common amongst those with rosacea to experience a drop in self-esteem and self-confidence. But, there are many steps you can take to restore your self image and to see yourself for the brilliant person that you are.</p><p>Depending on how significantly you’ve been impacted, it may be worth taking the time to see a psychologist to work through some of these feelings. Continuing to nourish your body with good food, good company and enriching experiences goes a long way too. On top of all this, recognizing that you’re not defined by certain features is key. Overall, it’s important to know that you’re not alone if you’re feeling down after a rosacea diagnosis.
